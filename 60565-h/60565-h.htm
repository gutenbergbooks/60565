<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>



<p><span class="smcap">Dinner</span> was served unusually early that
evening, and was an embarrassing
ordeal from which Peggy was thankful
to escape. On her way upstairs, however,
Rosalind called her back with an
eager petition.</p>

<p>“Oh, Peggy! would you mind awwanging
some flowers? A big hamper
has just awwived from town, and the
servants are all so dweadfully busy. I
must get dwessed in time to help
mother to weceive, but it wouldn’t matter
if you were a few minutes late.
Thanks so much! Awfully obliged.”</p>

<p>She gave her thanks before an assent
had been spoken, and tripped smilingly
away, while Peggy went back to the
big room to find a great tray full of
hothouse treasures waiting to be arranged,
and no availing vases in which
to place them. The flowers, however,
were so beautiful, and the fronds of
maidenhair so green and graceful, that
the work was a pleasure; she enjoyed
discovering unlikely places in which to
group them, and lingered so long over
her arrangements that the sudden striking
of the clock sent her flying upstairs
in a panic of consternation. Another
quarter of an hour and the Vicarage
party would arrive, for they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
bidden a little in advance of the rest,
so that Robert might help his mother
and sister in receiving their guests.
Peggy tore off dress and apron, and
made all the speed she could, but she
was still standing in dressing-jacket
and frilled white petticoat, brushing out
her long waves of hair when the door
opened and Esther and Mellicent
entered. They had begged to be shown
to Miss Saville’s room and came rustling
in, smiling and beaming, with woollen
caps over their heads, snow shoes on
their feet, and big fleecy shawls swathed
round and round their figures, fastened
with a hairpin on the left shoulder, in
secure and elegant fashion. Peggy stood
brush in hand, staring at them and
shaking with laughter.</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ho! I hope you are warm
enough! Esther looks like a sausage,
and Mellicent looks like a dumpling.
Come here, and I’ll unwind you. You
look as if you could not move an inch,
hand or foot.”</p>

<p>“It was mother,” Mellicent explained.
“She was so afraid we would catch
cold. Oh, Peggy, you are not half
dressed. You will be late! Whatever
have you been doing? Have you had
a nice day? Did you enjoy it? What
did you have for dinner?”</p>

<p>Peggy waved her brush towards the
door in dramatic warning.</p>

<p>“Rosalind’s room!” she whispered.
“Don’t yell, my love, unless you wish
every word to be overheard. This is her
dressing-room which she lent to me for
the occasion, so there’s only a door
between us.—There, now, you are free.
Oh, dear me, how you have squashed
your sash! You really must remember
to lift it up when you sit down. You
had better stand with your back to the
fire to take out the creases.”</p>

<p>Mellicent’s face clouded for a moment
but brightened again as she caught
sight of her reflection in the swing
glass. Crumples or no crumples, there
was no denying that blue was a becoming
colour. The plump, rosy cheeks
dimpled with satisfaction, and the flaxen
head was twisted to and fro to survey
herself in every possible position.</p>

<p>“Is my hair right at the back? How
does the bow look? I haven’t burst,
have I? I thought I heard something
crack in the cab. Do you think I will
do?”</p>

<p>“Put on your slippers and I’ll tell
you. Anyone would look a fright in
evening dress and snow shoes.”</p>

<p>Peggy’s answer was given with a
severity which sent Mellicent waddling
across the room to turn out the contents
of the bag which lay on the couch, but
the next moment came a squeal of consternation,
and there she stood in the
attitude of a tragedy queen, with staring
eyes, parted lips, and two shabby black
slippers grasped in either hand.</p>

<p>“M—m—m—my old ones!” she
gasped in horror-stricken accents.
“B—b—b—brought them by mistake!”
It was some moments before her companions
fully grasped the situation, for
the new slippers had been black too,
and of much the same make as those
now exhibited. Mrs. Asplin had had
many yearnings over white shoes and
stockings, all silk and satin, and tinkling
diamond buckles like those which
had been displayed in Peggy’s dress-box.
Why should not her darlings have
dainty possessions like other girls? It
went to her heart to think what an improvement
these two articles would
make in the simple costumes, then she
remembered her husband’s delicate
health, his exhaustion at the end of the
day, and the painful effort with which he
nerved himself to fresh exertions, and felt
a bigger pang at the thought of wasting
money so hardly earned. As her custom
was on such occasions she put the whole
matter before the girls, talking to them
as friends, and asking their help in her
decision.</p>

<p>“You see, darlings,” she said, “I
want to do my very best for you, and if
it would be a real disappointment not to
have these things, I’ll manage it somehow,
for once in a way. But it’s a
question whether you would have
another chance of wearing them, and it
seems a great deal of money to spend
for just one evening, when poor dear
father——”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, no, don’t think of it!
Black ones will do perfectly well. What
can it matter what sort of shoes and
stockings we wear? It won’t make the
least difference in our enjoyment,” said
Esther the sensible, but Mellicent was
by no means of this opinion.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that! I love
white legs!” she sighed dolefully.
“All my life long it has been my
ambition to have white legs. Silk ones
with little bits of lace let in down the
front, like Peggy’s. They’re so beautiful!
It doesn’t seem a bit like a party to
wear black stockings, only of course I
know I must, for I’d hate to waste
father’s money. When I grow up I
shall marry a rich man and have everything
I want. It’s disgusting to be
poor. Will they be nice black slippers,
mother, with buckles on them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dearie. Beauties! Great
big buckles!” said Mrs. Asplin lovingly,
and a few days later a box had
come down from London, and the slippers
had been chosen out of a selection
of “leading novelties”; worn with
care and reverence the previous evening
“to take off the stiffness,” and then
after all—oh, the awfulness of it!—had
been replaced by an old pair in the
bustle of departure.</p>

<p>The three girls stared at one another
in consternation. Here was a catastrophe
to happen just at the last moment,
when everyone was so happy and well
satisfied! The dismay on the chubby
face was so pitiful that neither of
Mellicent’s companions could find it in
her heart to speak a word of reproof.
They rather set to work to propose
different ways out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>“Get hold of Max, and coax him to
go back for them!”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t, it’s no use. It’s raining
like anything, and it would take
him an hour to go there and come
back.”</p>

<p>“Ask Lady Darcy to send one of the
servants——”</p>

<p>“No use, my dear. They are
scampering up and down like mice, and
haven’t a moment to spare from their
own work.”</p>

<p>“See if Rosalind would lend me a
pair!”</p>

<p>“Silly goose! Look at your foot. It
is three times the size of hers. You will
just have to wear them, I’m afraid.
Give them to me and let me see what
can be done.” Peggy took the slippers
in her hands and studied them critically.
They were certainly not new, but then
they were by no means old; just respectable,
middle-aged creatures, slightly
rubbed on the heel and white at the
toes, but with many a day of good
hard wear still before them.</p>

<p>“Oh, come,” she said reassuringly,
“they are not so bad, Mellicent! With
a little polish they would look quite
presentable. I’ll tap at the door and
ask Rosalind if she has some that she
can lend us. She is sure to have it.
There are about fifty thousand bottles
on her table.”</p>

<p>Peggy crossed the room as she spoke,
tapped on the panel and received an
immediate answer in a high complacent
treble.</p>

<p>“Coming! Coming! I’m weady.”
Then the door flew open; a tiny pink
silk shoe stepped daintily over the mat,
and Rosalind stood before them in
all the glory of a new Parisian dress.
Three separate gasps of admiration
greeted her appearance, and she stood
smiling and dimpling while the girls
took in the fascinating details—the
satin frock of palest imaginable pink,
the white chiffon over dress which fell
from shoulder to hem in graceful freedom,
sprinkled over with exquisite rose-leaves—it
was all wonderful—fantastic—as
far removed from Peggy’s muslin as
from the homely crepon of the Vicar’s
daughters.</p>

<p>“Rosalind! what a perfect <i>angel</i> you
look!” gasped Mellicent, her own
dilemma forgotten in her whole-hearted
admiration, but the next moment memory
came back and her expression changed
to one of pitiful appeal. “But oh,
have you got any boot polish? The
most awful thing has happened. I’ve
brought my old shoes by mistake!
Look! I don’t know what on earth I
shall do if you can’t give me something
to black the toes.” She held out the
shoes as she spoke, and Rosalind gave
a shrill scream of laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! Those things! How
fwightfully funny; what a fwightful joke!
You will look like Cinderwella, when she
wan away and the glass slippers changed
back to her dweadful old clogs. It is
too scweamingly funny, I do declare!”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind what you declare!
Can you lend us some boot polish, that’s
the question!” cried Peggy sharply.
She knew Mellicent’s horror of ridicule,
and felt indignant with the girl who
could stand by secure in her own beauty
and elegance, and have no sympathy for
the misfortune of a friend. “If you have
a bottle of Peerless Gloss or any of those
shiny things with a sponge fastened on
the cork, I can make them look quite
respectable, and no one will have any
cause to laugh.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha,” trilled Rosalind once
more, “Peggy is cwoss! I never knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
such a girl for flying into tantwums at a
moment’s notice! Yes, of course, I’ll
lend you the polish. There is some in
this little cupboard—there! I won’t
touch it in case it soils my gloves. Shall
I call Marie to put it on for you?”</p>

<p>“Thank you; there’s no need—I can
do it! I would rather do it myself!”</p>

<p>“Oh—oh, isn’t she cwoss! You will
bweak the cork if you scwew it about like
that, and then you’ll never be able to
get it out. Why don’t you pull it
pwoperly?”</p>

<p>“I know how to pull out a cork,
thank you; I’ve done it before!”</p>

<p>Peggy shot an angry glance at her
hostess, and set to work again with
doubled energy. Now that Rosalind
had laughed at her inability, it would
be misery to fail; but the bottle had
evidently lain aside for some time, and
a stiff black crust had formed round the
cork which made it difficult to move.
Peggy pulled and tugged, while Rosalind
stood watching, laughing her aggravating,
patronising little laugh, and
dropping a word of instruction from
time to time. And then, quite suddenly,
a dreadful thing happened. In the
flash of an eye—so quickly and unexpectedly,
that, looking back upon it,
it seemed like a nightmare which could
not possibly have taken place in real
life—the cork jerked out in Peggy’s
hand, in response to a savage tug, and
with it out flew an inky jet, which rose
straight up in the air, separated into a
multitude of tiny drops and descended
in a flood—oh, the horror of that
moment!—over Rosalind’s face, neck
and dress.</p>

<p>One moment a fairy princess, a
goddess of summer, the next a figure
of fun with black spots scattered thickly
over cheeks and nose, a big splash on
the white shoulder, and inky daubs dotted
here and there between the rose leaves.
What a transformation! What a
spectacle of horror! Peggy stood transfixed;
Mellicent screamed in terror,
and Esther ran forward, handkerchief
in hand, only to be waved aside with
angry vehemence. Rosalind’s face was
convulsed with anger; she stamped her
foot and spoke at the pitch of her
voice, as if she had no control over her
feelings.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh! You wicked girl; you
hateful, detestable girl! You did it on
purpose because you were in a temper!
You have been in a temper all the afternoon!
You have spoiled my dress! I
was ready to go downstairs. It is
eight o’clock. In a few minutes everyone
will all be here, and oh, what shall I do—what
shall I do! Whatever will mother
say when she sees me?”</p>

<p>As if to give a practical answer to
this inquiry, there came a sound of
hasty footsteps in the corridor, the door
flew open, and Lady Darcy rushed in,
followed by the French maid.</p>

<p>“My darling, what is it? I heard
your voice. Has something happened?
Oh-h!” She stopped short, paralysed
with consternation, while the maid wrung
her hands in despair. “Rosalind, what
<i>have</i> you done to yourself?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing! It was Peggy
Saville; she splashed me with her horrid
boot-polish—I gave it to her for her
shoes. It is on my face, my neck, in my
mouth——”</p>

<p>“I was pulling the cork. It came
out with a jerk. I didn’t know; I didn’t
see!”</p>

<p>Lady Darcy’s face stiffened with an
expression of icy displeasure.</p>

<p>“It is too annoying! Your dress
spoiled at the last moment! Inexcusable
carelessness! What is to be done,
Marie? I am in despair!”</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman shrugged her
shoulders with an indignant glance in
Peggy’s direction.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to do. Put on
another dress, that is all. Mademoiselle
must change as quick as she can. If I
sponge the spots, I spoil the whole thing
at once.”</p>

<p>“But you could cut them out, couldn’t
you?” cried Peggy, the picture of woe,
yet miserably eager to make what
amends she could. “You could cut
out the spots with sharp scissors, and the
holes would not show, for the chiffon is
so full and loose. I—I think I could
do it, if you would let me try!”</p>

<p>Mistress and maid exchanged a sharp,
mutual glance, and the Frenchwoman
nodded slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is true; I could rearrange
the folds. It will take some time, but
still, it can be done. It is the best plan.”</p>

<p>“Go then, Rosalind, go with Marie;
there is not a moment to spare, and for
pity’s sake, don’t cry! Your eyes will
be red, and at any moment now the
people may begin to arrive. I wanted
you to be with me to receive your guests.
It will be most awkward being without
you, but there is no help for it, I
suppose. The whole thing is too
annoying for words!”</p>

<p>Lady Darcy swept out of the room,
and the three girls were once more left
alone, but how changed were their
feelings in those few short moments!
There was not the shadow of a smile
between them; they looked more as if
they were about to attend a funeral than
a scene of festivity, and for several
moments no one had the heart to speak.
Peggy still held the fatal cork in her hand,
and went through the work of polishing
Mellicent’s slippers with an air of the
profoundest dejection. When they were
finished she handed them over in dreary
silence, and was recommencing the
brushing of her hair, when something in
the expression of the chubby face
arrested her attention. Her eyes
flashed; she faced round with a frown
and a quick “Well, what is it? What
are you thinking now?”</p>

<p>“I—I wondered,” whispered Mellicent
breathlessly, “if you did it on
purpose! Did you <i>mean</i> to spoil her
dress and make her change it?”</p>

<p>Peggy’s hands dropped to her side,
her back straightened until she stood
stiff and straight as a poker. Every
atom of expression seemed to die out of
her face. Her voice had a deadly quiet
in its intonation.</p>

<p>“What do you think about it yourself?”</p>

<p>“I—I thought perhaps you did! She
teased you, and you were so cross.
You seemed to be standing so very near
her, and you are jealous of her—and she
looked so lovely! I thought perhaps
you did....”</p>

<p>“Mellicent Asplin,” said Peggy
quietly, and her voice was like the keen
east wind that blows from the icy-covered
mountains, “Mellicent Asplin, my name
is Saville, and in my family we don’t
condescend to mean and dishonourable
tricks. I may not like Rosalind, but I
would have given all I have in the world
sooner than this should have happened.
I was trying to do you a service, but you
forget that. You forget many things!
I have been jealous of Rosalind, because
when she arrived, you and your sister
forgot that I was alone and far away
from everyone belonging to me, and
were so much engrossed with her that
you left me alone to amuse myself as
best I might. You were pleased
enough to have me when no one
else was there, but you left me the
moment someone appeared who was
richer and grander than I. I wouldn’t
have treated <i>you</i> like that if our positions
had been reversed. If I dislike Rosalind,
it is your fault as much as hers; more
than hers, for it was you who made me
dread her coming!”</p>

<p>Peggy stopped, trembling and breathless.
There was a moment’s silence in
the room, and then Esther spoke in a
slow, meditative fashion.</p>

<p>“It is quite true!” she said. “We
<i>have</i> left you alone, Peggy; but it is not
quite so bad as you think. Really and
truly we like you far the best, but—but
Rosalind is such a change to us.
Everything about her is so beautiful
and so different, that she has always
seemed the great excitement of our
lives. I don’t know that I’m exactly
fond of her, but I want to see her,
and talk to her, and hear her speak;
and she is only here for a short
time in the year. It was because we
looked upon you as really one of ourselves
that we seemed to neglect you,
but it was wrong all the same. As
for your spoiling her dress on purpose,
it’s ridiculous to think of it. How could
you say such a thing, Mellicent, when
Peggy was trying to help you, too? How
<i>could</i> you be so mean and horrid?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’m sure I wish I were
dead,” wailed Mellicent promptly.
“Nothing but fusses and bothers, and
just when I thought I was going to be
so happy! If I’d had white shoes, this
would never have happened. Always
the same thing! When you look forward
to a treat, everything is as piggy
and nasty as it can be! Wish I’d never
come! Wish I’d stayed at home, and
let the horrid old party go to Jericho!
Rosalind’s crying, Peggy’s cross, you
are preaching! This is a nice way to
enjoy yourself, I must say!”</p>

<p>Nothing is more hopeless than to
reason with a placid person who has
lapsed into a fit of ill-temper. The two
elder girls realised this, and remained
perfectly silent while Mellicent continued
to wish for death, to lament the general
misery of life, and the bad fortune
which attended the wearers of black
slippers. So incessant was the stream
of her repinings, that it seemed as if it
might have gone on for ever, had not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
servant entered at last with the information
that the guests were beginning to
arrive, and that Lady Darcy would be
glad to see the young ladies without
delay. Esther was anxious to wait
and help Peggy with her toilette, but
that young lady was still on her dignity
and by no means anxious to descend to a
scene of gaiety for which she had little
heart. She refused the offer, therefore,
in Mariquita fashion, and the sisters
walked dejectedly along the brightly-lit
corridors, Mellicent still continuing her
melancholy wail, and Esther reflecting
sadly that all was vanity, and devoutly
wishing herself back in the peaceful
atmosphere of the vicarage.</p>

<h2><a name="LOOKING_BACK" id="LOOKING_BACK">LOOKING BACK:</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">A RETROSPECT, WITH SOME SURPRISING FIGURES AND A PRESENTATION TO THE EDITOR.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> JAMES MASON.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Excuse</span> me if I indulge in a personal reminiscence.
It is in every way a pleasant incident
to recall:—</p>

<p>Between nineteen and twenty years ago, in
the Dark Ages, when as yet there was no
<span class="smcap">Girl’s Own Paper</span>, I remember a quite
accidental meeting at luncheon in a London
restaurant with the present Editor. We had
become well acquainted before that, in
connection with a magazine of which he was
sub-editor and to which I then played the part
of contributor.</p>

<div class="figcenter w550">
<img src="images/i_340.jpg" width="550" height="575" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE AUTOGRAPH TEA-TABLE CLOTH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I found him full of a scheme he had in view,
a paper which he anticipated would be a
lasting success, for it was going to appeal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
and cater for those sensible girls who are always
in fashion and who hitherto had possessed no
magazine which they could call their very own.</p>

<p>From the restaurant we adjourned to the
Editor’s chambers, and there he read to me the
proof of the prospectus about to be issued,
announcing the publication of the first number
of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>. At this distance
of time I cannot recollect the terms of that
document, but, as it is not every day that
editors write prospectuses, we may take it for
granted that it was a very moving discourse
which no girl could read without wishing at
the very least to see Number One.</p>

<p>The confidence of the Editor in his project
was infectious. Confident he was, and
confident he deserved to be, for he had had
considerable experience and, it was clear, knew
well what he was about. From that day I
believed in the fortunes of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own
Paper</span>. It is true that we might have paused
to consider how it is impossible to tell beforehand
what will hit the public taste, but to the
enthusiasm of so long ago that fact was only
a sort of bogey to frighten enterprising spirits
from starting anything new.</p>

<p>Beginning with that interview it is pleasant
to follow the career of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own
Paper</span>, leading up to its present flourishing
fortunes. As the day is judged by its dawn,
so girls apparently made up their minds about
the aims, quality, and character of their special
organ from the very first number. When it
came out, “You are a treasure!” was uttered
in every tone of voice, and with every inflection
of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The sunshine of that time has lasted up till
now. From being a new serial <span class="smcap">The Girl’s
Own Paper</span> has become a well-established
favourite, with an influence for good in the
community to which an outsider to the editorial
office like myself may with propriety call
attention. It is a paper which has been
always in the front in advocating what is best
for girlhood; always up-to-date; always
interesting; always, one can see, trying to be
sensible, and—without forcing its recognition—never
losing sight of the highest subject
of all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few figures relating to the publication
will no doubt be found of interest, showing,
as they do, what a considerable enterprise
the Editor entered upon when he launched
his first number on the sea of public favour.</p>

<p>The thousand numbers now completed
have endeavoured to bring their influence to
bear by means of about ten thousand articles
on subjects of all kinds interesting to girls.
This is not counting fiction. When we come
to fiction, we find that <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own
Paper</span> has aided in the innocent amusement
of its readers by the publication up to the
present time of close on a hundred serial
stories, and five times as many short stories
and stories completed within the limits of a
monthly part.</p>

<p>Suppose a girl, a model of perseverance,
wanted to read through the whole thousand
numbers aloud without skipping a word, she
could not do it in much less than a year,
reading for eight hours a day. She would
have her reward at the end of that time, for
she would have stored away in her head a collection
of valuable matter which would make
her a “none-such” for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>The illustrations have been about as many
in number as the articles—excluding fiction.
If a girl wanted to go through them all, giving
to each one only half a minute of her time,
she would have a picture-show that would last
over ten days, giving to it eight hours a day.</p>

<p>If all the columns of matter were cut out
and pasted in one long strip, the thousand
numbers would stretch out as a narrow pathway
over seven miles.</p>

<p>The figures are more startling when we
come from columns to lines. Take all the
lines of printed matter in the thousand
numbers and extend them in one long line.
Then whoever wants to run and read at the
same time will have to run over a hundred
and forty-five miles before she gets from the
first words of Number One which were “Zara,
or, My Granddaughter’s Money”—that being
the title of the first story—down to the last
syllable of the present number. Such is the
distance the editorial eye has had to travel
over. It is about thirty miles further than
from London to Bristol, nearly twice as far
as from London to Southampton, about three
times as far as from Edinburgh to Glasgow,
and a little less than three times the distance
from London to Brighton.</p>

<p>Taking the whole circulation of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s
Own Paper</span> from the issue of the first number,
we arrive at an imposing result. Suppose
that instead of distributing the copies to
subscribers, they had been hoarded up and
made to form a tall pillar, one copy being
laid flat on the top of another. And supposing
a girl wished to read the topmost
number—the present number, that is to say—without
using a ladder, she would have to
wait till she grew to be a hundred and seventy
miles high.</p>

<p>It would be a pillar towering into the air
to an inconvenient height, so it might be cut
into sections, each of about the height, say,
of Mont Blanc, and there would be about
fifty-six of these.</p>

<p>If all the numbers which have been circulated
since Number One were laid end to end, they
would make a pathway long enough to go
round the world at the Equator with a bit
over. If one could only contrive to carry it
over the sea, girls might in this way ramble
round and round the globe treading on their
own paper all the way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The publication of the thousandth number
of a magazine which can refer to such statistics
as these is certainly an event worth taking
note of. Making, as it does, a red-letter day
in the history of the paper, it was resolved, on
the kind and thoughtful suggestion of Mrs.
Emma Brewer—whom all our readers know—to
signalise it by presenting the Editor with
the autograph cloth shown in the illustration.
This wonderful tea-cloth was presented to him
at Christmas, together with a letter containing
the following cheering words:</p>

<p>“We hoped to have made this little gift
quite complete; there are however still some
names wanting, not for lack of inclination to
write them, but of time to collect them.</p>

<p>“Imperfect as it is, it is eloquent in its
expression of affection and good-will. As
such will you accept it and be cheered by it?
It is not only a tribute to you as a born editor,
but as a good sterling friend. We do not
think any other Editor in England will have
a like gift to-day.”</p>

<p>It is a recognition on the part of a hundred
contributors—literary, musical, and artistic—who
have served under his flag, of the ability,
friendliness, and discretion which have been
all along displayed in his dealings with his
staff. No one can go back, as I do, to the
very beginning of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>
without seeing how much it owes of its best
features to his presiding care. Under his
capable management and under that of a long
line of successors, to whom he will be able to
transmit the best maxims of editorial success,
there seems no reason why <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own
Paper</span> should not go on flourishing till the
printers have to add a fifth figure to the
number on the front page—and that will be a
hundred and seventy-three years and four
weeks from the present date!</p>

The piano has been sold.”</p>

The process is very simple. Take the egg in

stand perfectly upright even on a piece of glass.</p>

<p>The dog in Belgium is universally employed
in drawing barrows and small carts about the
streets. In Brussels alone over 5000 dogs are
so engaged, and the total number of draught-dogs

than 50,000.</p>

<p>Generations of servitude have made the
Belgian dog a race apart. For his size he is
said to possess the greatest pulling power of
any animal, four times his own weight being
considered a load well within his power.
Taking his average weight as half an hundredweight,
this means that something like 5000

<p>A wealthy Englishman, who had long lived
in Spain, had a lawsuit. He pleaded his
cause in person, and, knowing the customs of
the country, won his case. The victory cost
him three days of trouble and expense, so that
when the judge congratulated him on his

<p>“Yes, that’s all right; but it has cost me
three days, and time is money. I am a busy
man, and these three days are lost for ever.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you English!” answered the judge.

<p class="ph3">A BITTER EXPERIENCE.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox w125">
<img class="idropcap" src="images/i_342.jpg" width="125" height="267" alt='T' /></div>

<p><span class="uppercase">hat</span> march
from Verdun to
Bitche!
If Roy
Baron
should
live to be
a hundred
years old,
the bitter
memory
of it would
stand out
still, pre-eminent
among
memories.</p>

<p>He had
at first
only three
English
companions,
middle-aged
men, masters
of
merchantmen, accused of trying to
escape from close confinement in the
dungeon of the “Tour d’Angoulême”
of the Verdun citadel. There, for no
apparent reason beyond caprice, they
had been flung by the commandant’s
orders, and thence they were now no
less arbitrarily remanded to the worse
dungeons of Bitche.</p>

<p>They were honest sailor-like men,
rough in manner, but kindly; and they
looked with pity at the fresh-faced boy,
whom many a time they had seen in the
streets of Verdun. One of them spoke
to him, but Roy was in no mood for
talk. He held his head well up, and
strode resolutely along, with a spirited
imitation of the bearing which was
characteristic of Ivor; yet at his heart
lay a weight like lead. It was such
cruel work, being thus torn away from
all whom he loved, and sent he hardly
knew whither, merely for one little
boyish fit of recklessness.</p>

<p>At the first halting-place they were
joined by a second and larger company,
a party of English sailors, manacled
two and two, like criminals. Sailors of
the Royal Navy Roy knew at a glance,
and he caught a glimpse also of three
or four middies behind them. Then
his attention was called off, as, to his
unutterable wrath, he found himself
also on the point of being put into
fetters.</p>

<p>Roy Baron—son of a Colonel in His
Majesty’s Guards—to be handcuffed!</p>

<p>The blood rushed to his face, then
receded, leaving him as white as his
own shirt-front. He clenched his hands
fiercely; and the merchantman Captain,
who had addressed him at the first,
came a step nearer.</p>

<p>“Sir, it’ll be worse for you if you
resist! I wouldn’t, sir—I wouldn’t
really!”</p>

<p>As if in echo Roy seemed to hear
Denham’s voice speaking too. “Think
of your mother!” he had said. If he
endured patiently, Roy might be the
sooner sent back to her.</p>

<p>The frank weather-beaten face of the
sailor had an anxious look upon it. Roy
said gravely, “Thank you, Captain!”
and submitted, though not without a
sting of hot tears smarting under his
eyelids at the indignity.</p>

<p>Then he flung himself flat on the
ground, passionately hiding his face in
those manacled hands, and refusing the
coarse food that was offered to him.
He had money in his possession, but
Denham had advised him to be in no
haste to betray the fact.</p>

<p>“Never you mind,” a voice said
at his side, clear and chirpy as the
note of a robin. “There’s nothing to
be ashamed of, you know. It isn’t our
fault. The shame is for them—not us.
Cheer up, comrade.”</p>

<p>The combined childishness and manliness
of the tones made an odd impression
upon Roy, the more so as they
also brought a sense of something
familiar. He pulled himself up slowly.
One of the middies had drawn close; a
pretty boy, perhaps two years Roy’s
junior, with a rosy face, and any amount
of pluck in it.</p>

<p>Roy gazed hard at him, in growing
bewilderment.</p>

<p>“You’d better eat while you can.
None too good fare, eh?”—with the
same droll assumption of manliness.
“As for these”—and he lifted his little
brown manacled hands—“why, it only
shows we’re Englishmen. Ain’t you
proud of that? I am!” Then a pause,
and a stare. “O I say! My eyes!”</p>

<p>“I say!” echoed Roy.</p>

<p>“If you ain’t as like as two peas——”</p>

<p>“And you’ve a look——”</p>

<p>“It’s Roy Baron, as I’m alive!”</p>

<p>“And I declare it’s Will Peirce!”</p>

<p>The two tongues went fast for three
minutes. As little boys they had
played together, romped together,
worked mischief together, teased Molly
together, and together had usually
made up to her afterwards by spending
their joint pennies on splendid bull’s-eyes,
wherewith to comfort her wounded
feelings. For nearly five years the two
had not met.</p>

<p>“We weren’t beaten in fair fight,
don’t you think it,” Will asserted with
his chirrupy cheerfulness. “Got caught
in a trap. Damaged in a gale off Cape
Finisterre, and then when ’twas as much
as we could do to keep afloat, two
seventy-gun French frigates bore down
upon us. If she’d have answered her
helm, we’d have got the best of it, in
spite of all; but though we had a hard
fight, ’twas no go for us. They raked
us fore and aft, and we got riddled
through and through, so we were bound
to give in at last. I say, you set to
work and eat something. We’ve a long
way to go.”</p>

<p>Roy followed the wise counsel of
experienced boyhood, and did eat, feeling
better for it. Also, Will’s familiar
and plucky face brought a sense of
something like comfort.</p>

<p>“We’ll keep together as long as we
can,” Will said.</p>

<p>Then on again they marched, the
middies and Roy simply handcuffed;
the Royal Navy sailors and the
merchantmen sailors chained together,
two and two. The boys kept up a brave
heart, at least in outward seeming, however
weary and footsore they became;
and Roy held out as resolutely as anyone.
He seemed to himself indefinitely
older than Will; though in some respects
Will was more a man of the two, having
fought in two or three engagements, and
had one wound, besides coming in for a
nice sum of prize-money some months
earlier.</p>

<p>Now and again Roy would recur in
thought to Ivor’s long march from
Valenciennes to Verdun, all the way on
foot, though weakened by illness, and
then Denham’s pale face at the moment
of their parting would come up; was it
only that same morning? Already it
began to look like months ago. Roy
felt years older than when he had stood
on the ramparts, watching a crowd at
the gate. Was that indeed only two
days earlier?</p>

<p>Later in the day, when another halt
was made, a third company seemed to
be waiting to join them. A company of—were
they prisoners? Impossible.
Roy gazed in perplexity. For these
were French faces, sullen and downcast,
with French manners, and French
style of dress. Yet they too were
coupled together, like the English
sailors, two and two, by connecting
chains. They too were under an escort
of gendarmes.</p>

<p>“Are they convicts?” Roy exclaimed,
and the merchantman-master, Captain
Boyce, replied—</p>

<p>“Bless you, sir, no. Those are conscripts
for the Emperor’s grand army,
dragged from their homes, belike, without
a will-he nor a nill-he, and driven
to war like sheep to the shambles.”</p>

<p>“Poor wretches,” Will remarked,
with his experienced air. “I’ve seen a
lot of them before, on our way across
France.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough, sir, and so have I—times
and again. Looking as sheepish
too and as down in the mouth as ever
a man need look. It don’t make much
wonder neither, seeing they’re dragged
away from their homes and their sweethearts,
and never a chance of getting
off. O they’ll make smart soldiers
enough, I’ll be bound, and good food
for shot too, with a few months of
drilling, and be as ready to rave as any
Frenchman of them all for ‘le petit
Caporal,’ as they’re pleased to call the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>
Emperor. And the mothers and sweethearts
may bear the sorrow as they can,
and the land may go uncultivated, and
what does Boney care, so long as he
has his way?”</p>

<p>“But—conscripts for Napoleon!
French soldiers—chained!”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> uttered
Roy.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, sir, it’s this way.
They’ve got to be taken from their
homes to the dépôt; and scarce a man
among ’em wouldn’t desert on the road,
if he’d a chance of doing so. When
they’ve been in the army a few weeks or
months, disciplined and turned into
proper soldiers, they’ll learn a pride in
their new position, and things’ll be
different; but at the first ’tis hard upon
the poor chaps. Why, look you, I’ve
heard of a young fellow being taken
straight off, just as he was on the point
of being married, and the marriage put
off, nobody knew how long. As like as
not, in six months he’d be in a soldier’s
grave.”</p>

<p>Roy thought of Lucille.</p>

<p>“’Tis not our English way with our
soldiers,” he said, in reference to the
sight before them.</p>

<p>“No, sir. But”—and a queer smile
gleamed on the weatherbeaten face—“but
I’m not one for to go for to say
that even old England is never in the
wrong. You’ve maybe heard o’ such
matters as the work of the press-gangs,
that force men to go to sea against their
will; carry ’em off captive, in fact.
Many a brave tar, in His Majesty’s
Service at this moment, who’d give his
life for his country, and never a
moment’s hesitation, was kidnapped at
the first and dragged away, unwilling
enough, I can tell you.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>“More shame for them, if they didn’t
want to fight for the liberties of England!”
retorted little Will, with the
dignity of a man three times his size.</p>

<p>The chained and dejected conscripts
followed in rear of the prisoners, as the
march was resumed.</p>

<p>Day after day it went on. A hundred
leagues were not to be accomplished on
foot quickly, by a large number of
men and boys, of varying powers, many
of them used to shipboard life, and entirely
unused to long tramps. There
were tender feet and weary limbs
among them before long, and things
grew worse each day. Food was poor,
and at night when they halted they
were put to sleep in the common
prison of the place, no matter what
manner of prison it might be. Roy
would have found it hard to rest, in such
accommodation as was provided, but
that he was usually far too weary to
keep awake.</p>

<p>He was carefully guarding the money
with which he had been abundantly
supplied by his father; not allowing it
to be known that he possessed more
than a few loose coins, sufficient for
immediate needs. Impulsive Roy would
hardly have been so reticent, but for
injunctions at the last from Ivor. Like
Ivor, he was naturally open-handed and
generous, and he could not but share
freely what he had in hand with the
middies, since they proved to be ill
supplied with cash.</p>

<p>At length the long march came to an
end. Bitche was reached—a grim and
solemn fortress, sheltering already hundreds
of English prisoners, waiting to
engulf these new arrivals in addition.</p>

<p>Roy and the middies together were
first taken to the “Petite Tête,” so-called,
where each one underwent a
severe searching, lest he should have
concealed about him either weapons of
defence, or instruments which might be
used for purposes of escape. Roy’s
bag of money and notes was detected
in this search, and he knew that thenceforward
the gendarmes would look upon
him as lawful prey.</p>

<p>No immediate attempt was, however,
made upon him. He and the middies
were led through gloomy passages to
one of the great subterranean dungeons,
descending some sixty steps, into a
place which has been described as not
unlike a huge wine-vault. Originally it
had been dug out of the solid saltpetre
rock, and was some thirty feet below the
surface of the ground.</p>

<p>In this vault, dimly-lighted, heavy and
dank in atmosphere, with water here
and there dripping from the roof or
running down the walls, was gathered a
motley crowd of some three hundred
prisoners. English soldiers, English
sailors, English middies, détenus from
Verdun and elsewhere, were mingled
with swindlers, pickpockets, and highwaymen;
and even English gentlemen
and officers of higher rank sometimes
found themselves consigned here,
though, unless they gave particular
offence, they were more commonly installed
in smaller rooms above ground.</p>

<p>With the measured descent down
and down those stone steps, Roy’s heart
sank lower and lower. Was this what
he had come to? And for how long?</p>

<p>An outburst of uproarious cheering
hailed the new arrivals, as the heavy
doors were unlocked and they were
ushered in. Three shouts were given;
then each was hoisted on the shoulders
of three or four men, and was paraded
round the dungeon. After this rough
welcome, came a severe blanket-tossing,
which both Roy and the middies were
wise enough to take in good part. Any
who wished to fight were then cordially
invited to do so; and lastly those who
possessed money were called upon to
treat others to drink, provided by the
gendarmes.</p>

<p>Such initiatory ceremonies being
ended, comparative quiet descended
on the scene. It was past eight o’clock
when they first arrived, and night was
near.</p>

<p>Roy Baron’s first night in a French
dungeon!</p>

<p>Each prisoner was provided with a
worn blanket, cast off by a French
soldier; and wrapped in these the
crowd of over three hundred men and
boys laid themselves down to rest. Some
slumbered silently; some tossed to and
fro; some snored loudly; some talked
or shouted in their sleep. Roy lay amid
the throng, a ragged blanket round him
also. At first he had rejected it with
scorn; but these subterranean regions
were cold and damp, and, shivering, he
had at length drawn it round him, as he
lay with arms crossed, and face pressed
into them. The handcuffs had been
removed.</p>

<p>He was not thinking of the bruises
which he had received, when the rough
blanket-tossers had allowed him to drop
upon the stone floor. Bruises to a
hardy boy are a small matter. But the
desolation of the lad that awful night
went beyond bounds, and desperate
blank despair took possession of him.</p>

<p>For hours he hardly stirred. He
could not sleep. He could only lie in a
trance of misery. He saw no gleam of
hope, no chance of escape from this
terrible place. Yet, to stay on here,
week after week, month after month,
perhaps even as some had done year
after year! Could he bear it? Through
all previous troubles Roy had borne up
bravely; but at last his spirit gave way
beneath the strain.</p>

<p>Molly’s face came up before his mind—not
Molly the sedate and ladylike
maiden of sixteen, but Molly the little
eager girl whom he remembered. O to
see her again! Roy pressed his face
closer into the folded arms, writhing
silently.</p>

<p>Then his mother’s face—he hardly
dared to think of that. What would not
she suffer? unknowing, indeed, what
her boy had to endure; but fearing and
conjecturing the worst, so far as she
had knowledge to picture that worst.
Would any picturings of hers approach
the reality?</p>

<p>A wild craving for Denham had him
next in its grasp. If Denham had but
been arrested too—had but come with
him! But that unworthy wish lasted not
ten seconds. Upon it came a nobler rush
of gladness that Denham was <i>not</i> here.
The worn face came up before Roy, as
he had seen it but a few days sooner;
and below his breath he sobbed in an
ecstasy of thankfulness, that at least
Denham would be in comparative comfort,
that at least he had not to be in this
dungeon.</p>

<p>“Think how your mother will be
praying for you.”</p>

<p>Was that Denham speaking? Roy
seemed to hear the words, not only with
his mind, but with his bodily ears.</p>

<p>He sat up and looked round upon the
slumbering throng—looked with smarting
eyes into the gloom. He gazed into
the blackness overhead, where a stone
roof shut him pitilessly in.</p>

<p>Was his mother praying for him then?—and
his father?—and Denham?
Would God hear their prayers?</p>

<p>Denham’s voice again, deep and
quiet, seemed to breathe around him,
“Remember! God is overall!” How
long ago was it that he had said those
words? Not lately. Was it—when he
was ordered off to Valenciennes?</p>

<p>God over all? Ay, even here, even in
this dungeon!</p>

<p>Roy dropped down again, face foremost;
and through heaving sobs, not
one of which was allowed to make itself
heard, he joined his prayers to those of
his mother.</p>

<p><span class="uppercase">he</span>
printer
has
put a
fourth
figure
to the
number
on the
front page
of this issue,
and
the Editor makes
his bow to his faithful
readers—of whom there
must now be many millions—and congratulates
them on having done their
part, the most important of all, in bringing
this magazine to so enviable a point
in its history.</p>

<p>To all girls who now read its pages,
and to all who have read it in the past,
he sends hearty greetings and offers his
sincere thanks for their loyal support.
Everyone works best when his labours
are appreciated, and the Editor feels
that he ought, at least, to have done
well, for he has pursued his task accompanied
by a constant chorus of
friendliness and encouragement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first idea of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own
Paper</span> came as a happy thought to the
present Editor about twenty years ago,
at a time when he was closely connected
with the management of two other
magazines long well known to the
public.</p>

<p>It appeared to him that there was a
real want of a paper which girls could
truly call <i>their own</i>:  a paper which
would be to the whole sisterhood a
sensible, interesting and good-humoured
companion, counsellor and friend, advocating
their best interests, taking part
in everything affecting them, giving
them the best advice, conveying to them
the best information, supplying them
with the most readable fiction, and trying
to exercise over them a refining and
elevating influence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To meet this want he proposed the
starting of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span> to
the present proprietors. By them the
suggestion was well received—indeed,
they themselves had about the same time
conceived the notion of a magazine for
girls—but many doubts and difficulties
were expressed as to the carrying of it
out, which was natural, seeing the venture
meant the sinking of a considerable
amount of capital. At last, however, the
decision to start the paper was arrived
at and careful preparations were made
for launching the first number on Saturday
the 3rd of January, 1880.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the nearly twenty years which
have elapsed since then the Editor has
been aided in every possible way by the
society who own the paper. They have
enabled him to conduct it on the most
liberal principles of expenditure, and the
business management has been such
as to make easy what at times might
have proved burdensome. Also to the
Editor-in-Chief of the Society’s magazines,
Dr. Macaulay, the hearty thanks
of the Editor are due for liberty of
action and a great deal of kindly
encouragement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first number appeared on the
Saturday we have just named. Success
shone upon us from the very first, and
<span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span> at once and
by general consent took a foremost
place amongst the magazines of the
day.</p>

<p>Professional critics in the Press were
generous, and said many a friendly
word in our praise. The late George
Augustus Sala elevated <span class="smcap">The Girl’s
Own Paper</span> to the position of “first
favourite,” and in an encouraging
notice expressed a hope that “all the
girls” of Great Britain would subscribe,
for he thought it would be greatly to
their advantage.</p>

<p>Much-valued approval and friendly
letters of advice and help also came to
us in these early days from Mr. John
Ruskin, who, writing to a girl friend,
said that he had ordered the paper to
be sent to him regularly, and added,
“Surely you young ladies—girls, I
ought to say—will think you have a fair
sixpenny worth.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But better and more important than
even the praise of the critics was the
appreciation of the girls themselves.
Everywhere throughout the country, far
away in the colonies, and up and down
all over the world, we found we were
being read, valued, and talked about by
those for whose benefit the paper had
been produced. Girls were unanimous
in recognising the merits of this new
friend and in letting it be seen that <span class="smcap">The
Girl’s Own Paper</span> was to be henceforth
a welcome and, indeed, indispensable
visitor in all their homes. It was a great
and gratifying success.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The favour with which the paper was
received has been continued up to the
present time, and the Editor is in hopes
that, by pursuing the course that has
done so well hitherto, he will be enabled
to retain it for many a day to come.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No matter what a girl’s tastes or needs
may be, on looking into <span class="smcap">The Girl’s
Own Paper</span>, she will sooner or later
find what she is in want of. We are
not going here to compile a list of the
thousand and one subjects that have
been treated of in our pages. It is
enough to say that there is not a single
topic of interest to girlhood to which
our paper has not given, or is not going
to give, attention. Whether a girl
merely wants to read what will make
the hours fly fast, or, what is more important,
wants to know what will add to
her value and usefulness, let her turn to
<span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>. There never
has been in this country, or indeed in
any other, a storehouse of material by
means of which girls can make the most
of their lives, at all to be compared
with it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A valuable feature of our paper has
been the Answers to Correspondents,
which have appeared with such regularity,
and been read with such pleasure,
ever since its commencement. The
magnitude of this department, and its
ceaseless flow of incoming letters, would
surprise anyone admitted behind the
scenes for the first time. In these
answers, innumerable items of information
have been given, countless criticisms
have been ventured on, and an attempt
has been made to solve a great many of
the problems and difficulties that enter
into the thoughts and lives of our
readers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Letters have also been received daily,
during these nineteen years and more,
by the Editor, which have not been answered
publicly in our correspondence
columns, and these communications he
has now much satisfaction in mentioning.
They have come from girls in all
parts of the world, and without exception
have borne testimony to the usefulness
of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>. Not a few
have told how it has had a good and
wholesome influence on the minds of the
writers, acknowledging in no measured
terms that it has enabled them to lead
wiser and better lives. And many a
solitary girl has written how she has
found it the best possible company,
coming to her—and punctually too—with
all the inspiring influence of a cheerful
friend.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another feature not to be forgotten in
the progress of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>
is to be found in the many competitions,
by means of which we have from time to
time tested the ingenuity, taste, accomplishments,
skill, and perseverance of
our readers. These have occasionally
roused a remarkable degree of enthusiasm.
In one of the most successful,
we well remember, the papers came in
such numbers, that the Post Office had
to send a special van with them, and
one sackful took four men to carry it
upstairs.</p>

<p>A large amount of money has, from
first to last, been distributed amongst the
winning competitors, and a great many
certificates of merit have been granted
to those who, whilst failing to get a
prize, obtained a certain percentage of
marks. These certificates have been
much valued and not a few have been
found serviceable as testimonials to
painstaking and ability, when girls have
had to make their way in the world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And not only have our readers received
benefit themselves. Influenced,
as the Editor knows them to have been,
in the direction of true charity by the
writings of some of our contributors,
they have tried in their turn to be of
service to others, and through the
medium of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span></span>
have done much useful work for the
community.</p>

<p>They have, for example—at the suggestion
of the Countess of Aberdeen,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
who has ever taken great interest in
the magazine, notwithstanding her high
public and official positions—established
a working girl’s home in London; also,
they have re-established the Princess
Louise Home for Girls, subscribing with
touching readiness and liberality to each
of these schemes in actual cash over a
thousand pounds. They have besides
made periodical grants of warm clothing
for the poor, sent dolls in great numbers
to brighten the dull hours of sick children
in hospitals and in many other
ways shown a good sisterly interest in
those less happily circumstanced than
themselves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Editor has been assisted in his
labours by a band of very willing workers—authors,
musical composers, and
artists—whose names are familiar to all
our readers. Many of these have been
associated with him from the commencement
of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>
up to the present time—faithful, industrious,
enthusiastic helpers, eager to
give of their best and thoroughly in
sympathy with the young.</p>

<p>Some of our authors had already made
their mark before they appeared in our
pages; but others were unknown, and it
is a great pleasure to the Editor to think
that he has been the means of bringing
into public notice not a few who are now
universally acknowledged as writers of
ability.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But whilst surrounded by a tried staff,
the Editor has made it a rule to welcome
contributions—indeed, to invite them—from
every quarter. If the topic be
suitable, the writer well informed, and
the manner interesting, no manuscript
ever goes away rejected from the door
of the Editorial Office. Amongst our
occasional contributors may be seen the
names of a queen, several princesses,
and leading members of the nobility,
and a great many more who have distinguished
themselves in various lines of
activity connected with the life and work
of women and girls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Editor is well aware that his
readers would like to see the portraits
of some of the tried and true friends who
have given such devoted service. He
therefore adds them here, and they
form, he thinks, a fitting accompaniment
to this notice of what has led up—in
quite a marvellous manner, and by God’s
blessing—to the publication of the present
<span class="smcap">Thousandth Number of The
Girl’s Own Paper</span>.</p>

<img class="idropcap" src="images/i_346.jpg" width="125" height="133" alt="F" /></div>

<p><span class="uppercase">or</span> some months
past, my dear
girl friends, I
have been
equally gratified
and
troubled by
the sight of a
large pile of
your letters
on my table—gratified,
because
they are full of sweet
confidences, requests for advice and help,
grateful allusions to benefits which have
resulted from our talks in the twilight, and
affectionate expressions towards myself. As
a whole, your letters have been a source of
great joy to me; but, on the other hand, it
has grieved me to think that some of you
have hoped and waited in vain for replies
which never came.</p>

<p>Believe me, I would have written to each
and all of you had it been possible. Conscience
does not reproach me for having
wilfully neglected you; but I have had a good
many heartaches on your account.</p>

<p>Who does not know the trial of looking and
waiting in vain for a friend’s letter?</p>

<p>I cannot now address you singly; but an
open evening will again bring us more into
touch with each other, as a former one did a
few months ago.</p>

<p>It is alike delightful and wonderful to note
the results of that night’s talk, during which
we had glimpses of each other’s thoughts,
needs, and longings. Subsequent letters have
shown me how the words of one girl-writer
have stirred the hearts of many to prayer on
her behalf, and in some cases they have asked,
“How can I be of real use to another member
of our gathering?”</p>

<p>Some have been brought into closer
relationship with each other as correspondents,
and I trust the result will be beneficial to all
of them.</p>

<p>Several of my correspondents have asked
that evenings should be devoted to subjects
of special interest to themselves and many
others, but which do not come within the
scope of our object in meeting. Let me
remind you, dear friends, who, from the most
worthy motives, have suggested the consideration
of such subjects, how varied are the
classes, ages, nationalities, and even the
religious views of those who meet with me in
the twilight. It will be obvious to you that
the usefulness of our meetings would be
imperilled, were we to introduce any subject
likely to arouse an antagonistic feeling even in
the minds of a few.</p>

<p>Several of our recent talks have been
devoted to smoothing away the difficulties
which many dear girls meet with in their first
efforts at self-dedication. They are answers
to inquiries and requests for help which have
come from many quarters. I do earnestly
hope and pray that, by God’s blessing, they
will be found useful and helpful to many
others besides my dear correspondents.</p>

<p>I think that many amongst you who ask
questions would do well to refer back to some
of our earlier talks, which all who now meet
with me may not have read. They began in
September, 1896, and have been continued
monthly ever since.</p>

<p>It is delightful to find how many of my girls
do refer back to the old talks for help and
comfort; and, to you all, it must be very
cheering to know that God has blessed the
words of some to the good of others. Here
is an instance. One dear correspondent had
been telling me a great deal about the many
worries and anxieties of daily life, and of the
relief it was to open her heart to someone
who was, she felt sure, “interested in us
girls.”</p>

<p>With a mother ill in bed, and who must
not be told anything about the worries
incidental to the large family, the servants,
and home which needed constant oversight,
my young correspondent was feeling overweighted,
and wrote—</p>

<p>“Oh, how mistaken people are who think
one has nothing to do but take it easy and
enjoy oneself! If they only knew! Still, I
am wicked to grumble so! These little
‘thorns in the flesh’ are nothing compared
with what so many have to bear. This
morning I was ready to break down and have
a real hearty cry, a thing I do not often
indulge in. I had no opportunity just then.
I took up at random a back number of the
‘G. O. P.’ and opened it at the ‘Twilight
Talk.’ It seemed just meant for me. There
was an extract from the letter of a girl who
seemed to have my feelings exactly, and her
words did help me so. I hope you will never
give up writing to us whilst you are able to
do so. I pray for you and for all our
‘Twilight Circle,’ and that we may all, both
you and me, gain more and more blessing
from our monthly meetings.”... “I do so
want to make a fresh start and try to overcome
my temptations. It is so nice to know that
you are praying for us—for me. May the dear
Lord bless you exceeding abundantly with the
blessing that maketh rich and addeth no
sorrow to it, is the prayer of ‘One of your most
loving girls.’”</p>

<p>You will all, I am sure, understand, that in
giving abstracts from such letters, I am anxious
for every member of our “Twilight Circle”
to share a great pleasure with me. That
our talks should have been so largely blessed,
and that the interest taken in them is
continually deepening and extending, is a
matter which concerns each of us. We <i>must</i>
all benefit by being permitted to read each
other’s hearts and knowing that we are not
alone in our experiences, whether of joy or
sorrow.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how two or three words
often stir us to sympathy and incline us to
confidence. Here is an instance from the
letter of one who had lately known a great
sorrow.</p>

<p>“Last month I was feeling so miserable
when my paper arrived; and somehow I felt
better after reading that kind remark you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>
made about someone who told you she was a
‘motherless bairn.’ I have lost my mother
too, and have not yet got used to being
without her. You will understand how dreary
everything seems sometimes; but when I read
the ‘Twilight Talks,’ it makes me feel that
there is still something left to live for. My
life seems very poor and mean when judged
by your standard, and it is very hard to reach,
and sometimes seems a hopeless task.”</p>

<p>I pause here to say that the standard I
strive to place before you, beloved ones, and
myself, being God’s standard, as shown to us
in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ, makes all
our lives seem poor and mean—none more so
than my own. Thanks be to God! He has
taught me by His Spirit to look from my own
weakness to His strength, from my sinfulness
to Him, in whom I believe, and “Who bare
my sins in His own body on the tree”; from
my poor efforts after holiness, which are too
often only a record of failures, to the perfect
righteousness of Christ, which is the precious
heritage of all who trust in His sacrifice alone
for salvation.</p>

<p>We must not give up striving, or lose
courage by looking too much at ourselves.
We must look up to Christ, and, though we
have sorely lagged behind in our attempts to
follow Him, and met with many disappointments
by the way, we must still keep on.
We must endeavour to imitate the Christ-life,
but trusting the while in the sweet assurance
that “He became sin (or a sin-offering) for us
that we might become the righteousness of
God in Him.”</p>

<p>Looking at self, we despair. Turning from
self to Christ, we find that He has fulfilled the
whole law, and that, believing in His finished
work, we are “justified by faith and have
peace with God.” Yet, even when we do
realise what Christ has done, how dissatisfied
we are with our own poor efforts to show that
we love and want to be like Him! Everything
in Him is so grandly perfect, and so
many littlenesses creep into our best efforts
that we are ashamed to look at them.</p>

<p>A dear correspondent gives us a picture
which many of us will own to be a reflection
of our own feelings.</p>

<p>“I am one of His weak ones, yet longing
to live the life that shall glorify Him most.
The thing that grieves me so is that I have so
little love in my heart towards Him. It is
not strong as it ought to be; but Jesus is so
precious to me that I want above all things to
lead others to Him, that they may know what
a Saviour He is!”</p>

<p>Happy girl! To be able to see so much in
Christ, so little in self! It is the dissatisfied
disciples who cannot be contented to follow
their Master “afar off.” They <i>must</i> be ever
praying and striving after a closer union with
and greater likeness to their Lord. If one of
you should write and say, “I am quite satisfied
with myself, I am doing the best I can, and I
am sure nobody can find fault with me,” I
should be very, very sorry for her.</p>

<p>The student who has mastered the rudiments
of a science does not sit down contented
with the little he knows. He looks to the
highest level of knowledge which has been
attained by those who have gone before him,
and says to himself, “If hard work, earnest,
painstaking study and perseverance will do it,
I will go a step beyond.”</p>

<p>Many years ago I stood by the death-bed of
one who had long passed the fourscore years
whose strength is described in God’s word as
“labour and sorrow.” She did not talk of
what she had done for Christ; but in a few
words expressed her sense of what He had
done for her.</p>

<p>“All in Christ—nothing in me.”</p>

<p>A volume could not have expressed more
than did these half-dozen words; but the
light in those aged eyes, and the expression
on the face were pledges of the sincerity of
the dying speaker.</p>

<p>May you go on and on until, losing sight of
self and its poverty of service and of love,
you can say, “I have fought the good fight,
looking to the Captain of my salvation for
courage, and strength, and grace; and now
the battle is drawing to a close I can only say,
Thanks be to God who giveth us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ!” “All in
Christ—nothing in me.”</p>

<p>A correspondent who signs herself “One of
your grateful, loving girls,” sends a most
interesting letter, of which I give an extract.</p>

<p>“I ought to write and tell you how much I
have been helped by your talks with us in the
‘G. O. P.’ It is nice to read about other
girls’ lives, and I hope we shall be able
to help each other. I was at a meeting
one afternoon, and, before singing a certain
hymn, we were told not to join if we did not
really understand it. It was one only a
Christian should sing. I felt able to say the
words. I am very thankful to God for many
blessings and for strength to overcome temptation;
above all, for the love that He has put
into my heart. Will you please join with me
in the prayer that I may grow rich in grace?”</p>

<p>Yes, dear girl; and I trust that every
member of our “Twilight Circle” will join in
the petition that, not you only, but all of us
may “grow in grace and in the knowledge of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.” With
such growth ever widening and spreading
throughout the great human family, what a
happy world would this become!</p>

<p>So many correspondents allude to their
beloved mothers whom “God has called
home.” It is a joy that our talks have been
especially helpful to several of them. It is
sweet to be claimed as “deputy mother,” and
to read such words as these—“I always turn
to the ‘Twilight Talk’ first, and read it out
so that another as well as myself can enjoy it.
We girls all make a confidant of you, our real,
true friend.” “I address you not merely as a
friend, but as a dear, kind mother.”</p>

<p>“I love you just as if I had known you all
my life,” writes another; and then she gives
me a sketch of the school life she had enjoyed
so much, and of the trial it had been for her
to turn her back upon it. The leaving school
was unavoidable, and I honoured the writer
for her brave efforts “to pretend not to feel it
too much” for the sake of the parents who
were as sorry as herself. “But that is all
over now, and I long to do my very best in
whatever place God may put me. I have
made many mistakes, failures, and slips, but I
do feel Christ more precious than ever before.
Our ‘talks’ do help me. I hope you will
<i>never</i> give them up before you are positively
unable to write. Tired of them! No,
indeed! I have a Christian home, for which
I cannot thank God enough, and I have a
Sunday School class of children between seven
and nine. Oh, I do want to teach them to
love my Lord, and I tremble lest my life
should contradict my words! It is so nice to
think you pray for us all. I like to think the
‘all’ includes me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much for bringing all us girls
together. The dear old ‘G. O. P.’ deserves
our gratitude for many things, but never so
much as for this.” During our former “open
evening,” I quoted from a letter signed “<i>Une
de vos filles</i>,” and now it makes me happy and
will do you good to share part of a second from
the same writer. She is quite a stranger to
me, in one sense, for I do not know her
personally—I wish I did—and am equally
ignorant as to her home and surroundings.
She has had a serious illness since she wrote
to—shall I not say “us”?—before, and now
her second letter will do us good again, though
it is too long to be quoted in its entirety.
Alluding to my quotation from her former
letter, she writes, “I wonder if you can
imagine my mingled feelings when your words
caught my eye. There was gratitude to God,
love to you, astonishment, gladness, and yet
shame. It is quite true that I am happy and
thankful for all God’s discipline, but I am
often impatient, cross, and rebellious. Though
the impatience may not reach the length of
words, it ought not to be in the heart. It
grieves me to find how much evil there is yet
to be subdued. Still, I could not help feeling
glad when I read what you said, for it made
me happy to know that my letter had given
you pleasure; and when you called it ‘a little
bit of work done for Christ,’ that gave me more
joy—it was so unexpected to find it used as a
message to others.”</p>

<p>Here I must miss words I would fain give
for all to read did space allow, and take
another passage. “I liked very much what
you said about not being in a hurry to speak
about Christ to others, but to live as a Christian
and wait an opportunity to speak for Him.
When in doubt as to the wisdom of speaking,
I’ve asked Him to give me three things, the
words, the opportunity, and the courage, and
He always does, or makes me content to wait
longer. It needs all three from Him, and if
the first two are given, (and don’t you believe
we can feel when they are?) the third is sure
to come too. Sometimes the words are ready
weeks and months, and then, if I’m watching,
the opportunity comes. It is grand to know
that Nehemiah’s God is as ready to hear and
help now. There is time for the needed
courage and wisdom to be sent even between
the question and the answer. You don’t mind
my writing again, do you? When the heart
is full it must overflow, and mine was so full of
love and thanks, yet of that feeling of
unworthiness, that I had to tell you. You
seemed a dear and well-known friend before,
now you are more so than ever. By-and-by,
when we remember all the way which the
Lord our God has led us, it will be nice to look
back to our words, one to another, as to something
that helped us heavenward and made the
‘way’ a little easier, and to know that it was
part of His leading all the time.”</p>

<p>Are not you, the dear friends with whom I
am sharing my precious letters, glad of the
privilege of looking over my shoulder or of
listening whilst I read them? Do we not owe
much gratitude to those of our circle who allow
us the privilege of learning from their experience,
especially when it gives us new and
sweet proofs of God’s faithfulness and love in
leading His children?</p>

<p>As I finished this letter from “<i>Une de mes
filles</i>,” I felt such a longing to bring her into
communication with some of my other correspondents
who seem to be groping blindly and
helplessly after God. They want to know Him,
serve Him, love Him, yet are wandering in all
directions save the right one, and are cherishing
doubts, brooding over isolated passages in
God’s Word, and entertaining hard thoughts
of Him Who “is love,” because of occasional
texts which they cannot fully understand.</p>

<p>I want very much to write to some of these
correspondents, who seem to me all the dearer
because of their troubled minds and the eager
questionings which prove that they are in
earnest in their search after truth. But I cannot
answer them here and now. I have so
many pressing duties which cannot be put
aside, and which make additional correspondence
most difficult. Dear troubled ones,
you are not forgotten. I ask always that a
better help than mine may be given you, and
I want you to look round amongst your friends
and think whether there may not be quite near
at hand, some kindly earnest Christian who
will delight in being a comfort and help to
you. In one of our old talks on “confidences,”
I gave you some examples of those
who went far afield to find what was really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
close at hand. In any case, I hope to write
to several of you whose real names and
addresses I have, or through the Correspondence
page, with the Editor’s permission.</p>

<p>I must give one or two brief extracts which
prove how greatly many of the members of our
“Twilight circle” value such religious communion.
“A periodical is so vastly improved
when the spiritual side of one’s nature is
looked after and fed.” “It is most encouraging
and cheering to know that God’s name is
upheld in the magazine read by so many girls
as well as those more advanced in life. I get
such blessing out of our little ‘Talks in the
Twilight.’ So many would not buy what
they call a ‘religious book,’ and these talks
give them the opportunity of seeing a few
words from the ‘Book of books’ when they
otherwise would not.”</p>

<p>This sweet message came on Christmas
morning. “Another year has passed and we
have still been meeting in spirit; and, in the
enjoyment of our ‘Twilight Talks,’ I am sure
we must all feel very thankful that we have
been permitted to see another year. I am
certain most of us, if not all, have derived still
further good from the loving, spiritual instruction.
E—— is, I am pleased to say, quite a
different girl, and, with God’s help, is continuing
to overcome her besetting sins. She
still enjoys the talks, and the first thing each
month is to look what subject has been chosen,
so interested is she.” You will all rejoice with
me in knowing that this dear girl’s life has
been marvellously influenced for good by our
meetings, and her mother adds, “I, as one
amongst many, thank you for the benefit that
has been wrought in our home. I too have
learned many useful things on the duty of a
mother to her children. The work is influencing
the older as well as the younger classes, so
there is no limit to the good effected, under
God’s blessing.” I have only touched my
pile of letters, and there are such delightful
ones unquoted from—piles of them. What
can I do but just add how truly they are
appreciated, and thank all the writers for
them, and God for having stirred them to open
their hearts so fully so me?</p>

<p>Who, after reading what I have quoted
here and there, will say that religious teaching
is deemed superfluous by, or is other than
welcome to, the dear girls and friends of all
ages who meet with me in the twilight?</p>

<p>I hope to take “Sunday” and “Rest” at
one of our meetings, in compliance with many
requests.</p>

<p>To all dear correspondents I send loving
thanks, sympathy, and the assurance that I
long to be of use to them. Also the prayer,
“May God bless and help each and all according
to their needs.”</p>

<h2><a name="GIRLS_AS_I_HAVE_KNOWN_THEM" id="GIRLS_AS_I_HAVE_KNOWN_THEM">GIRLS AS I HAVE KNOWN THEM.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> ELSA D’ESTERRE-KEELING, Author of “Old Maids and Young.”</p>


<h3>PART V.</h3>

<p class="ph3">THE GIRL WHO GOES IN FOR ART.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“To me more dear, congenial to my heart,</div>
<div class="verse">One native charm than all the gloss of art.”—<i>Goldsmith.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="figcenter w200">
<img src="images/i_348a.jpg" width="200" height="271" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last girl of
the girl-who-goes-in-for-art
type that I have
known is one
Norma.</p>

<p>She is owner
of a studio having
few pictures
in it, and those
few indicating
that she holds
what was Balzac’s
view of <i>le
beau</i> (<i>c’est le
laid</i>). It used
to be a point of
courtesy to term
ugly persons clever; it has become a point
of courtesy to term ugly pictures so. They
offend this girl direfully who do not so term
her ugly pictures.</p>

<p>Quite as typical as she is the girl who shares
her studio.</p>

<p>Picture to yourself a curiously invertebrate-looking
person of some prettiness of that
distinctive type to which the name pre-Raphaelite
is a little vaguely applied, a girl
with lips habitually parted and her tongue
much shown, this giving her a foolish look,
as the same thing gave Coleridge a foolish
look. Just as Coleridge had, however, a fine
brain, so has this girl. Among a thousand
and one affectations under which she hides her
very real cleverness, a leading one is that
which distinguishes her speech. She favours
adjectives with the suffix <i>some</i>. “Lovesome”
is in high vogue with her. This word found
favour with Chaucer, so it may pass. “Dovesome”
is less pleasing, though it is handy as
a rhyme. Other two adjectives in “some”
favoured by the girl who shares Norma’s
studio are “oilsome” and “weepsome.”
She apologises for extending an “oilsome”
hand; she describes a kindly act as “weepsome.”</p>

<p>Altogether this girl’s use of descriptive
words is very remarkable. She more rarely
has recourse to the French language than her
ancestresses had. The words <i>recherché</i> and
<i>distingué</i> are never heard from her; but, so
far from its being true that she taboos French
altogether, she prefers <i>banal</i> to “trite,” and
<i>bourgeois</i> to “vulgar.” This thing is the
more regrettable that she pronounces French
less well than her predecessors did.</p>

<p>The vein of censure of the girl who goes in
for art is, it is only fair to say, on the whole
mild. Her abomination is the cheap and the
shoddy, but she rarely uses these words
because, she says, they pain her mouth. For
<i>old-fashioned</i> she uses preferably “suburban”
(pronounced <i>s’burban</i>), or “early-Victorian,”
or “rococo.” These words are not synonymous,
but she uses them as synonyms. Finally, her
use of the word “elementary” is interesting.
A symmetrical arrangement of wall-pictures
is objected to by her as “elementary.”
Symmetry is a thing very abominable to her.</p>

<p>This girl’s name is Margaret, and she is
called in her circle “the Meg.” The girl who
goes in for art is rarely called by her name.
This thing was so ten years ago, when some
of us knew a girl whose initials were W. P.,
and whose nickname was Willow Pattern.</p>

<p>This girl was lovely and was loved. Her
lover was woefully poor, but that troubled
Willow Pattern not at all. He had, she said,
“a rich chin.” They married, and they are
to this day as happy as happy can be. <i>Nota
bene:</i> They are still poor, the world says;
for the world is so blind that it has never
noticed that Willow Pattern’s husband has a
rich chin.</p>

<p>They manage to eke out a living by picture-painting.
If they would paint portraits they
would be somewhat less poor, but they will
not do that. A British matron tells how she
once in this matter fared with Willow Pattern.</p>

<p>“I want you,” said the British matron, “to
paint my portrait.”</p>

<p>Said Willow Pattern, “Sorry I can’t do
that; but I will make a picture of you if you
like; I shall put a
swan in it, and call it
‘Woman and Swan.’
Do you mind?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, rather,”
admitted the British
matron. “I wanted
to be done as just me;
but never mind, you
shall have the job all
the same.”</p>

<p>Said Willow Pattern
(gasping), “I beg your
pardon.”</p>

<div class="figcenter w200">
<img src="images/i_348b.jpg" width="200" height="307" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Said the British matron, “Now get out
your paints, child, and <i>do</i> me.”</p>

<p>So far there has been nothing said of Lilla.
Lilla, by the irony which often rules in names,
is a sallow, shady-lipped girl. Her hair is
dressed in one thin plait worn round the head,
and I always see her as I last saw her—sitting
before a cup of cold tea, with the milk like a
mackerel sky on it. She was talking to
another girl. I did not hear their talk, being
myself in conversation with the fourth person
present, but I noticed the singular beauty of
Lilla’s voice, and here and there such fragments
of quaint inversion as, “Hither came,”
“I like it much,” “Think you?”</p>

<p>Next of kin, mentally,
to the girl who
goes in for art is the
girl who goes in for
art-criticism. This girl
sits much with her
hands folded and reads
reviews not only of
books, but of pictures
and concerts. There
is such a girl in London
of to-day who never
knows how much or
how little she has enjoyed
a concert until
after perusal of the
subsequent morning’s
paper. This girl is aged sixteen.</p>

<div class="figcenter w200">
<img src="images/i_348c.jpg" width="200" height="304" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Going in
for
Art criticism</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is such another girl in London upon
whom a perfect raid is made by persons
humorous when the Academy exhibition of
pictures opens. Most people, not professional
artists, according to this girl, go about picture-exhibitions
idiotically admiring everything.
Nothing will induce her to believe that this
spirit of admiration is perhaps not so much
the result of idiotcy as it is the result of a
clear consciousness on the parts of those
feeling it that they lack all painting ability
and so may fairly regard, with mingled wonder
and delight, the work of persons who, to
state the case for them at the lowest, do not
lack all painting ability.</p>

<p>Sentimental nonsense that, according to the
girl who goes in for art-criticism, and who
points out that here the projection of a shadow
is obviously wrong, there the execution is
flabby; here the design is feeble; there the
treatment of the lights, while striking, is
technically questionable. If all that came
from a girl at first hand, one would lose all
hope of her, but every word of it has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
read where most of us can read it, and a
certain <i>naïveté</i> attaches to the pompous
retailing of it, which <i>naïveté</i> is as a saving
grace; howbeit there are persons who will not
recognise this fact. It is said of a great
painter living that
he “foams at the
mouth” when a certain
young girl is
named, because she
once told him for his
encouragement that a
picture of his was in
her deeming “beautifully
felt;” and there
is a pianist of note
who vows that he will
remember till his
death that a young
English girl informed
him that he had “a beautiful finger.” The
jargon of art on the lips of young girls
apparently fails to please.</p>

<div class="figcenter w200">
<img src="images/i_349a.jpg" width="200" height="265" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Felt
badly</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is another vein of language which the
girl with artistic tendencies sometimes works,
and which equally
misses, in some cases,
the desired effect.</p>

<p>“What is your sister
like?” asked a boy of
another boy recently.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s one of
those girls who jabber
about sunsets,” was the
answer. “Want to
speak to her?”</p>

<p>“Not me!”</p>

<div class="figcenter w200">
<img src="images/i_349b.jpg" width="200" height="291" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The
despiser
of
sunset</p></div>
</div>

<p>Wit is not a shining
quality of this type of
girl, but once in a while she contrives to be
quits with the other person.</p>

<p>“In my days,” said a severe old person
some little time ago, “a girl could only be
one of three things: a teacher, a shop-girl,
or a servant-maid. To-day you can be doctor,
gardener, whatnot. You have only to make
your choice. My opinion being that you have
not the slightest talent for art, Gladys, let me
know what you would like to be.”</p>

<p>Gladys (piqued): “Of the three things you
have named, ‘whatnot’ displeases me least.”</p>

<p>The severe old person smiled.</p>

<div class="figcenter w200">
<img src="images/i_349c.jpg" width="200" height="258" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Two innocents
abroad, one
being likewise
artless</p></div>
</div>

<p>This sketch shall be brought to a close
with a story of two
innocents abroad, one
of them having been
the girl who goes in
for art.</p>

<p>They were evidently
trippers—wedding-trippers.
This is precisely
what happened.
They were standing before
a world-famed picture
in a world-famed
gallery. I, standing
albeit at some distance from them, seemed to
myself to be in fullest evidence; but perhaps
I was not. There were no other persons in
the room. The girl said—</p>

<p>“You should not say of a portrait, dear,
that it looks as if you could walk round it.
It sounds all right, but it’s the wrong thing
to say.”</p>

<p>To which he, smiling—</p>

<p>“Who told you so?”</p>

<p>“Reynolds.”</p>

<p>To which he, no longer smiling—</p>

<p>“Who’s Reynolds?”</p>

<p>“Never heard of Sir Josh——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I didn’t know you meant him.
Of course, I’ve heard of him. What made
him say that?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure; but it may have been that
he thought if you saw a real man you wouldn’t
say, ‘He looks as if you could walk round
him,’ and of course you wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>He, smiling anew—</p>

<p>“No, perhaps not.”</p>

<p>“Well, then”—she was now in fine pedagogical
vein—“looking at a man or woman
in a picture, you should feel just what you
would feel looking at a real man or woman.
That’s what I understand by it, dear.”</p>

<p>“You’re awfully clever, darling, and so
was Sir Joshua, no doubt; but it’s not human
nature to feel towards a man or woman in a
picture just what you would feel towards a
real man or woman.”</p>

<p>As he said this, the exponent of human
nature walked round the girl by his side, then
caught her in his arms and kissed her. When
this demonstration was over, she said—</p>

<p>“It would have been horrid, wouldn’t it,
dear, if anything had come between us and
our marriage? You needn’t say ‘yes,’ because
I know you mean it. Besides there’s somebody
over there, and perhaps she’s taking notes.”</p>

<p>Perhaps she was; she was in a public
building.</p>

<p>It is one characteristic by which you shall
know the girl who goes in for art, that she
and those with whom she by preference
associates behave in public very much as they
behave in private. This makes some frown,
and makes some—smile.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_RULES_OF_SOCIETY" id="THE_RULES_OF_SOCIETY">THE RULES OF SOCIETY.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> LADY WILLIAM LENNOX.</p>


<h3>PART III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">I left</span> off last time in rather an abrupt
fashion: but possibly the unfinished condition
of my article may—on the principle of serial
stories, which always exhibit a certain unexpectedness
and incompleteness in their instalments—have
given my readers an appetite, so
that, like Oliver Twist, they are “ready for
more.” I will therefore now proceed to
explain what was meant by the “other
thing” spoken of at the end of my paper.</p>

<p>It had reference to what is often felt to be
a difficulty with regard to country house visiting,
and consists in not knowing how long to
stay. When, as sometimes happens, the
duration of the visit is settled and plainly
mentioned beforehand, it is a real comfort; for
if you are invited for a week, or from such a
day to such a day, the dates being given,
there is no room for doubt: you know
exactly what is expected of you and can make
plans to suit. But when the invitation is
vague as to its ending, though explicit as to
its beginning, and you are asked to “come on
the 8th and stay with us; we shall have a few
cheery people,” it is hard to say for certain
whether the traditional three days, “press
day, dress day, and rest day,” as the line runs—though
for my part I fail to see where the
“rest” day comes in—are intended to cover
the time of your visit or whether a week is
meant. At all events it is always better to
be too short than too long as regards time
when others are concerned besides yourself.
A prolix, long-winded individual is invariably
fled from when he begins to speak, and anybody
who gets a reputation for outstaying his
or her welcome is not likely to be asked much
anywhere. It would be terrible to be known
as “that woman who can never be got rid of
when she once comes.” Far better is it to
arrange for a short visit, and then, should
your hostess really wish you to pay a longer
one, she can say so and try to persuade you to
alter your plans on her behalf. But, unless
it is quite clear that your company is still
desired, it is wise to keep to your original
intention, because sometimes politeness,
carried perhaps rather beyond what is necessary,
may be misunderstood, as really occurred
on one occasion when some people who had
paid an unreasonably long visit were leaving
the house at last, to the relief of their
entertainers. An unlucky impulse prompted
the hostess to say, “Good-bye, must you really
go?” Whereupon, to her dismay, the departing
guests turned with a smile and said, “Oh
no, we are not really obliged to go just yet,”
and they actually stayed. Here again we may
take counsel of the wisest of Books which
says, “Remove thy foot from thy neighbour’s
house lest he grow weary and hate thee.”</p>

<p>While on this subject it may be well to
remark that the same rule applies to all visits,
even what are called “morning” visits—calls
made because they must be made more than
with the idea of any pleasure to be evolved
therefrom. The temptation to remain too
long in such cases is, of course, not great,
but it does not follow necessarily that the
visitor goes just when she ought. Shyness,
a sort of difficulty in finding the right moment
in which to get up and say good-bye, perhaps
sometimes a feeling that you have seemed
stupid and dull, and that you must try and
sparkle somewhat before you go, to take away
the bad impression given of your abilities; all
sorts of little under-currents common to
human nature seem at times to hamper people
and make them do <i>gauche</i> things, among
them being that of sitting on when they ought
to leave.</p>

<p>Even if you are with a friend, not an
ordinary acquaintance, and have lunched with
her, it is better to make a move to depart soon
after; for although you may have nothing
particular to do that day, she may have,
and in London especially there is such a
pressure of things which must be got through
somehow that few of us can afford to let our
afternoon slip away, and with it the chance of
seeing such a person, going to such a shop,
writing important letters, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Now I will return to the country house, to
make a few observations, this time not to the
visitors, but to the visited; and, as I have all
through my articles tried to make it clear that
I do not address myself to people who live in
luxury, I wish to repeat that fact, and to say
that I have not “in my mind’s eye” a
magnificent castle with everything to match,
but a house on a modest scale and establishment
ditto.</p>

<p>You, inhabiting a nice, comfortable abode
of the kind, have bidden some guests to come
and stay; perhaps for an “At Home” in the
neighbourhood, perhaps with no special object
in view; but the country is pretty, they can
walk or “bike,” and there is the pony-carriage
and possibly a dog-cart, useful for men in the
shooting-season.</p>

<p>Well, first I hope you have not asked too
many, for, except in the case of very young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
girls who have scarcely been out anywhere, and
to whom a gathering means Elysium, never
mind what inconveniences in the shape of an
over full house—sofas to sleep upon and hardly
room to dress in—are attached to it, nobody
likes discomfort, and cramming ten people in
where there is only space for eight, or less,
does not conduce to comfort. Besides, too
many guests means too few servants for the
unwonted crowd, and consequently work has
to be hurried through and, in artistic parlance,
“scamped.”</p>

<p>Then you have dust not only lurking in
corners but coming boldly forth to view on
carpets and furniture, glass and china dull and
knives ditto, flowers drooping, half-dead for
want of water; in fact a complete absence of
those details which spell first cleanliness and
then charm in a house, and, taking them as a
whole, make the difference between enjoyment
of daily life and the mere endurance
of it for the sake of some brilliant hours in
prospect.</p>

<p>It is the business of a hostess to see that
her staff of servants is equal to the demands
made upon it, and then to exact thoroughness
in the work done; outside which there remain
many small matters for her personal attention,
such as putting writing materials in the
bedrooms, cards on which are printed the hours
for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the arrival
and departure of the post; and if in addition
to this a time-table of trains to and from
London is annexed, it will be found of great
value in sparing somebody the headache which
so often accompanies a prolonged study of
Bradshaw. A few books also, suited to the
tastes of whoever is to occupy the room,
should always be left on a shelf or table. They
look comfortable and are generally appreciated.</p>

<p>The mistress of a house must of course show
a pleasant countenance of welcome to her
visitors, and should be quick to notice little
signs of fatigue in the elders, contriving to
spare them too much talking when they ought
to be resting, without at all suggesting that
repose was needful because they are not quite
as young as they were, a thing which nobody
likes to believe patent to an ordinary observer.
With the younger members of the party she
must be as bright and “full of life” as her
physical and mental constitution will allow;
ready to make plans for amusement, and as
far as circumstances admit, arrange them to
suit the different dispositions of her guests;
not forcing the naturally inactive ones to join
in outdoor games, scramble through woods,
or take part in picnics when a chilly wind is
blowing, and black clouds render precautionary
umbrellas and waterproofs necessary items in
the outfit; nor, on the other hand, obliging
the athletic, to whom movement is indispensable
and good bracing air a regular “pick-me-up,”
to sit in the house because the weather
is bad, when they are really longing to don
thick boots and defy the elements with the
weapons of youth and health.</p>

<p>But while trying your best to provide some
sort of amusement for your guests, never forget
to “leave well alone,” and your visitors also.
If there is one thing more objectionable than
another to many people, it is being “hiked
about,” and told to go here and there, or do
this and that, when they do not want either
to go to or do the place or thing suggested.
Talleyrand once said to a man who asked
counsel of him respecting a project he had
very much at heart, “<i>Surtout pas trop de
zèle</i>,” and that advice it is well to bear in mind.
We all know the proverb, “One may have
too much of a good thing,” and “zeal,”
excellent in itself, is apt if over-much indulged
to become a nuisance to the object if not the
subject thereof.</p>

<p>The hostess who, with the best intentions,
insists on driving her friends even to things
they like doing, who says, “Now I know
what will suit you—the old ruins. We will go
there to-day, and to-morrow is the Gymkana.
We must all go there. Headache, did you
say? Oh, I thought you never had headaches,
but anyhow a nice little drive just to the ruins
can’t hurt. In fact the air will do you good.
Now, you, I know you would rather stay in,
so take that comfortable chair, and there’s
your book, I put it ready for you, and there’s
the <i>Morning Post</i>, or would you like the
<i>Times</i> better?” and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>, is a
person to be dreaded. “Kind woman,” say
her friends behind her back, “but, oh, if she
would only leave us alone!”</p>

<p>The essence of good manners, indeed, is to
make things as pleasant as possible by letting
people follow their own bent and inclination;
giving them the chance of joining in something
which may be agreeable, but dropping the subject
at once if it does not seem to be attractive.
Closely connected with this is manner itself,
about which it may be said perhaps, “People
cannot help their manner.”</p>

<p>That is true to a certain extent but not
entirely, for a good manner may be cultivated
and a bad one discouraged just as flowers may
be watered and attended to and weeds rooted
out. When I speak of a good manner, I do
not mean that specially soft demeanour which
reminds one somewhat of a cat and is often
accompanied by a little delicately hinted
flattery of the person spoken to, although
such manner is seldom thrown away, human
nature being very prone to approve of flattery
under the guise of appreciation. But I do
mean gentleness as contrasted with anything
like roughness or <i>brusquerie</i>. The Latin expression
“<i>Suaviter in modo</i>” conveys the
idea better than any words I know, and, in
women particularly, short sharp ways of
speaking, over-strong, almost violent, expressions
of opinion, and what may be called unoiled
words of contradiction, are disagreeable
in themselves and dead against every rule and
custom of society. If we possess a hand of
steel, let us hide it in a velvet glove. The
strength will be in no wise impaired thereby,
while our neighbours will be less sensible of
the hardness.</p>

<p>I must now say a word with regard to a
curious mistake made sometimes even by
people who certainly ought to know better.
The mistake is in leaving out part of a person’s
name whether in speaking or writing.
If, for example, a man is called “Lord
Frederick Smith,” or a woman “Lady Mary
or Lady Edward Jones,” the Christian name
must always be heard: not omitted in favour
of the surname only. Indeed very often the
former need only be mentioned, but the latter
alone must never be. “Lord Smith” or
“Lady Jones,” in the cases adduced above
would be quite incorrect, but, strange to say,
the error is not seldom committed.</p>

<p>Finally I will turn to the subject of most
women’s pleasure and difficulty, dress. That
is to say, dress when staying in country houses,
for with respect to London there is no occasion
to offer any observations, every woman being
a law unto herself, limited only by her own
taste and purse. But I know that sometimes,
if a visit is imminent, the question “What
clothes shall I take?” presents itself to the
mind in the light rather of a puzzle far from
easy to unravel, especially if ways and means
are not remarkable for abundance. Naturally
every girl and woman likes to look her best
when staying away with the chance of meeting
strangers and making a good or bad impression,
and in the case of women who have
reached the summer or autumn of life, there is
one comparatively simple mode of lessening
the toilette problem, which is to wear black.
Black in good condition, be it understood,
because shabby black has about it suggestions
of poverty and supreme effort, which are
neither becoming nor exhilarating. But silk,
satin, velvet, any material really handsome,
and lightened by lace and jet, can go anywhere
unashamed, while for morning gowns
cashmere, foulard, and that haven of refuge,
the ubiquitous serge, always look well and do
not date themselves too obviously. As for
hats and bonnets, everybody can please themselves,
remembering, however, that one hat
should be fit to stand rain, as nothing has a
worse effect than bedraggled ostrich feathers,
or artificial flowers and gauze or chiffon
crushed flat by a downpour. A short skirt is
also an essential, and perhaps, if the purse is
as short as the gown, an economy may be
arrived at by having two skirts of different
length to wear with the same coat. Neat
boots of course “go without saying,” and
plenty of gloves, a strong pair or two for
every day and a store of pretty ones for
occasions when they will be wanted. Tweeds
and serges, cottons and foulards to suit the
season—and the age of the wearer—are the
best materials for morning frocks whether in
black or colour. Silks and satins are quite
out of it in the country except for evening.
Tea-gowns <i>versus</i> regular dinner dresses is a
question to which an answer vague as those
of the Delphic Oracle can only be given, for
the excellent reason that the custom in one
house is no guide to it in another in the
matter. At some places when the party is
small and quiet, tea-gowns are quite in order
even at dinner, but in others those comfortable
garments are relegated to their proper sphere,
appearing only at five o’clock tea, the wearers
blossoming forth at a later hour in the
smartest and most up-to-date of toilettes.
Tea-jackets answer the purpose of tea-gowns,
but one or other should be packed, although
it may chance after all to stay in the wardrobe,
never being required either at tea or
dinner.</p>

<p>Some pretty frocks which would do alike
for party or dinner must be taken, and a few
odds and ends of ribbon, bits of lace and sprays
of artificial flowers, in case real ones are not to
be had from the gardener, come in useful
especially if an impromptu fancy dress dinner
is arranged, and “the shop” in the village,
with its stock-in-trade varying from candles
and ironmongery to very thin cottony ribbons of
abnormal hues, bunches of scarlet geranium,
and poppies with woolly buds, is the only
place where anything can be got.</p>

<p>In deciding what to take and what to leave
behind, space necessarily must be considered,
and it is astonishing the quantity of things one
person will bring out of a box, almost like a
conjuror and his inexhaustible hat, while
another woman can hardly make the same
sized receptacle hold half that number of
articles. The difference comes partly from
natural genius and partly from habit. In any
case it is better to take two or three trunks of
moderate dimensions than one mountain,
which taxes the strength of even railway-porters,
and makes servants look askance when
they see a sort of elephant in the hall, waiting
to be transported somehow upstairs. More
than all, have your luggage tidy, locks secure,
straps ditto. Bags and portmanteaus have a
way of getting out of order, as regards the
spring. I have seen specimens of both, strapped
certainly, but not really locked, so that an
aperture was visible all along the top, which
should have been closed, and I have felt sorry
for the owners.</p>

<p>These details, although they seem hardly in
touch with my subject, are yet not entirely
unconnected with it, inasmuch as one rule is
to encourage things pleasant, and avoid, or
ignore, things disagreeable. The wheels of
daily life run over rough as well as smooth
ground, and the inevitable jars and concussions
would be even more apparent than they are,
were it not for the oil provided by the Rules
of Society.</p>

<h2><a name="ANSWERS_TO_CORRESPONDENTS" id="ANSWERS_TO_CORRESPONDENTS">ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</a></h2>


<h3>MEDICAL.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Septemdecim.</span>—Probably you will go on growing
for five years longer. Besides which 5 feet 4 inches
is not so very short for a woman. It is a very good
medium height. It is extremely probable that you
will put on another couple of inches, and that in a few
years you will be writing to ask us how to get shorter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miserable.</span>—You are quite right in ascribing a
purely mental cause for your trouble. Blushing is
almost always due to mental and not to physical
causes. The form that your complaint takes is one
of the commonest we have to deal with. As the
cause is purely mental, so the treatment must be
solely a matter of mental education. A short time
ago we published an article on blushing, dealing
especially with the kind of blushing from which you
suffer. In that article we gave suggestions for the
suppression of self-consciousness—the factor <i>par
excellence</i> of the commoner varieties of blushing
and nervousness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Enigma.</span>—There is no such disease as “gastric fever.”
This name used to be given to various forms of
slight fever accompanied with symptoms referable
to the stomach or bowels. Most cases of “gastric
fever” were, in reality, mild attacks of typhoid
fever. Acute indigestion was also not infrequently
labelled gastric fever—an inappropriate term, for
in acute indigestion there is practically no fever.
The term “gastric fever” is not now used by
medical men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lal.</span>—The symptoms that you detail to us are capable
of many explanations. The two most definite
and important signs are occasional blood-spitting
and shortness of breath when going up a hill. Are
you sure that you do cough up blood? Most probably
your troubles are simply due to chronic catarrh of
the throat, but they may be dependent upon some
mischief in the chest. Anyhow, you should have
your chest examined before doing anything else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyspeptic.</span>—The bismuth lozenge of the British Pharmacopœia
contains two grains of subnitrate of
bismuth, precipitated chalk, and carbonate of
magnesia, together with mucilage, etc. It is very
useful for indigestion, especially when there is a
tendency to vomiting. The great use of these
lozenges lies in the ease with which they can be
carried about. When there is no tendency to sickness,
lozenges of bicarbonate of soda or soda-mint
are preferable to bismuth lozenges.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seeking Advice.</span>—The “small pimples” on your
face are manifestations of acne. We have so frequently
discussed this trouble that we cannot again
enter into a full description of its cause and cure.
Wash your face with warm water and sulphur soap,
and every evening apply sulphur ointment to the
place where the pimples are most numerous. Wash
away the ointment in the morning and squeeze out
a few of the most prominent spots. You are at the
age for acne, but with a little care you are not
likely to be troubled for long with it. For your
hands, wash in warm water and use sulphur soap.
Always wear thick gloves when you go out. We
published a small article on the care of the hands
some few weeks ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scotch Lassie.</span>—Your trouble is due either to indigestion
or to anæmia, or to nervousness, or possibly
to disease of the heart. Without examining your
chest it is beyond the power of any mortal to say
which of these various affections is troubling you.
Our advice is, therefore, go to your doctor and have
your chest examined. You may be disappointed
with this curt reply, but it is far more valuable
advice than you imagine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teething.</span>—There are four wisdom teeth. One on
each side of both upper and lower jaws. They are
called wisdom teeth because they do not develop
until mature years. The first to appear is usually
the one in the right side of the lower jaw. This
usually appears between the ages of twenty and
twenty-two. The wisdom teeth develop in nearly
everybody, not only in those who are wise. Nor
does the early appearance of the teeth indicate
superior mental powers. Indeed, savages and
idiots usually have the best teeth. Sometimes
they do decay very soon, but very often they remain
as sound serviceable teeth until the end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Lover of Dancing.</span>—A large vein in the leg is not
necessarily a varicose vein, but most probably it is
so or will become so in time. A varicose vein is a
diseased vein. It is very common, indeed, to have
varicose veins in one leg only. If so the left leg is
the more commonly affected. Is it your left leg
which is affected? Exercise in the form of dancing
for a few minutes every morning would be distinctly
good for varicose veins. It is standing and sitting
which are bad. The best thing for you to do is to
get an elastic stocking for the leg. Let the stocking
be one or two inches higher than the highest
point where the vein extends. If you wear an elastic
stocking, varicose veins are not dangerous, but if
they are left untreated they cause very serious
troubles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mona.</span>—Have the tooth removed. Teeth growing
out of place are quite useless, and are ugly and
uncomfortable. No. The condition is not at all
uncommon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anxious Mother.</span>—The question of the causation
of tuberculosis by milk is the most important question
in modern preventive medicine; for not only
is tuberculosis the most common and most fatal
disease of man, but milk is the staple food of infancy
and sickness—the two states in which we are most
prone to harbour germs of this terrible malady. To
the public mind tuberculosis is synonymous with
consumption of the lungs, but this is only one of its
manifestations. Brain fever (tuberculosis of the
brain) is a common and invariably fatal disease.
The joint troubles known as “white swelling,”
“hip disease,” and very many others are due to
tuberculosis. The so-called “scrofulous” glands,
which disfigure and undermine the health of so
many of our children, are due to tuberculosis. The
worst and most fatal form of diarrhœa is due to
tuberculosis of the bowels. No organ in the body
is exempt from the ravages of this disease. We
look with righteous horror at the plague, or the
various fevers which occasionally decimate our
towns and villages, but these are as nothing when
compared with the ravages of tuberculosis. Unlike
the fevers which destroy life in a few days, tuberculosis
usually takes months, often years, to kill its
victims. Slowly, but surely, this terrible malady
eats away the human organs till the unfortunate
sufferers die of exhaustion, or from an intercurrent
malady. To say that medical science can always
cure tuberculosis would be very far from the truth,
but it can and does rescue millions of sufferers from
the disease. And it can, and in the future it will,
do much to prevent the disease from gaining an
entrance to the body. The disease is caused by a
microbe, an infinitesimal atom of jelly, which cannot
even move; but it can, and does, multiply by splitting
in two, at an incredible rate. As regards the
prevention of this scourge, the first question we
must consider is, where does this dreadful organism
come from? Suffice it for your question that the
organism is frequently found in milk. True, it is
only in the milk of tubercular animals that these
organisms are found, but it is not always possible
to tell whether a cow has tuberculosis. And so,
notwithstanding every precaution, tubercular milk
does get into your milk-jug and that can scarcely
be prevented; but you can prevent the organisms
from finding their way into you or your child’s body
by the simple expedient of boiling the milk. If
you boil milk it cannot give you tuberculosis. Now,
we dare say you think that we might have said this
at once, and not wasted half a column of valuable
space in detailing the horrors of tuberculosis. Had
we done this you would probably not have paid any
attention to our warning. It is only by forcible
illustration that we can impress the mind with the
immense value of attention to trifling details. And
the importance of this detail may be gauged when
we aver that a law to enforce persons boiling their
milk would probably save more lives than the invention
of ships which could not possibly be injured
by wind or weather, or of railway trains which
could not collide.</p></div>


<h3>STUDY AND STUDIO.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p>D. E. N. S.—1. We cannot tell you of any French
lady who would exchange correspondence lessons
with you. But why not insert your name in our
“International Correspondence” column?—2.
Mudie’s Library, or Smith’s, extend their operations
to country districts. For light reading, you
might try one of these.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laurel.</span>—We have read your letter with great sympathy.
We cannot give a direct “yes” or “no”
to your question, as so much depends on the individual
habit of mind. Would you not like to read
a good translation (<i>e.g.</i>, Longfellow’s) of Dante’s
“Divine Comedy” on Sunday? We certainly
think you should employ your scanty leisure to the
best advantage; but there are many great poets
who are so spiritual in tone, that there could be no
doubt as to the fitness of studying them on this day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Semper Idem.</span>—1. You do not give us your address,
but there are plenty of classes in London for type-writing;
address The Secretary, Board of Technical
Instruction, St. Martin’s Lane, W.C. The art
appears to be very quickly learned as a rule.—2.
Your quotation,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Boys, flying kites, haul in their white-winged birds,</div>
<div class="verse">You can’t do that way when you’re flying words,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">is from “The First Settler’s Story” in Will Carleton’s
<i>Farm Ballads</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edwin C. R. Langley.</span>—Many thanks for your kind
suggestion. We remembered Longfellow’s mention
of St. Augustine; but Tennyson, though his
thought is similar, does not mean St. Augustine, or
even Longfellow by</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“Him who sings</div>
<div class="verse">To one clear harp in divers tones.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Our information, that the poet referred to was
Goethe, comes from one who had asked Tennyson
himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colleen Bawn.</span>—1. Your story is graphically written
and shows you to have a certain power of description.
The criticism—not, as you suggest, a severe
one—which we should be disposed to offer is this:—That
you are inclined towards an excess of sentimentality.
Why should the curate have felt “everything
was changed for him” after the scene in the
church? “Miss Amy” had given him no cause
whatever, so far as the reader can observe, for any
such despair. And his dying in the snow is unnecessarily
tragic. A sensible man, accustomed to
traverse the parish in all weathers, would have
guarded against losing his way on such a night as
you describe, probably by remaining under shelter
at the cottage till daylight, if no guide could be
found. One feels that the man’s life is quite needlessly
sacrificed for the sake of forcing the pathos.
We should not have said all this, had not your story
shown some signs of talent, and if you are neglecting
no duty by writing, we should advise you to
persevere.—2. Your handwriting is good, and you
appear to understand the art of punctuation, which
is by no means a matter of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frog.</span>—1. We should advise you to write to George
Philip &amp; Son, publishers, London, for a full catalogue
of geographical works of every sort at a low
price. Doubtless any bookseller would procure
this catalogue for you.—2. We should consider that
no soap can be of any possible use in reducing
weight. Plenty of exercise and proper diet are the
best remedies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White Aster.</span>—1. We do not consider your handwriting
good. The backward slope is not to be
admired, and in addition to this defect, it is very
irregular and untidy.—2. We have heard that a
coating of varnish is sufficient for the purpose you
name, but have never tried it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss E. K. Sibbald</span> (Canada).—Many thanks for
sending the extract stating that “Puss” is a modern
form of the Egyptian “Pasht”—a name given
by the ancient Egyptians to the moon, and also to
the cat, of which they made an idol. The cat’s face
was supposed to resemble the moon “because she
was more bright at night, and because her eyes
change just as the moon changes, which is sometimes
full and sometimes a bright crescent or half
moon.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clissold.</span>—All we can suggest is that you should
apply to the director or organizing secretary for
technical education in your district, asking him
where you can obtain instruction in “black and
white.” We believe that the address for Halifax
would be W. Vibart Dixon, Esq., West Riding Offices,
Wakefield. He would perhaps help you. Did you
read Mrs. Watson’s articles on “What are the
County Councils doing for Girls”? (<span class="smcap">The Girl’s
Own Paper</span>, 1897.) We advise you to refer to
them.</p>

<p>E. G. M.—Your poem on the “Dying Child” is incorrect
in metre. From verse to verse the lines
vary; for instance, your ear can tell you that these
lines are not alike—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh, weary watcher! thy care is all in vain.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Relentless watcher, thy name is Death.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Yet both lines occupy the same place in the verse.
“The Phantom Bell” is much better, so far as
form goes; but not quite accurate, and we fear you
would scarcely be able to find a publisher for it.
You should study the laws of versification.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Nicholls.</span>—1. We cannot insert your requirements
in full; but are willing to say that any reader,
not under twenty-four, acquainted with German,
French, and either painting or music (the latter
preferred), who feels she would like to work with
another lady in teaching and share her house, may
write to you for further details.—2. Your poems
are very fairly good, especially the translations.
The first two verses of the Italian specimen do you
credit. We also proceed to notice, at your request,
A Romance Languages Club, Secretary, Miss
Nicholls, Laburnum Villa, Leamington. “The
club is designed to promote the intelligent study of
the Romance Languages—French, Italian, Spanish
and Portuguese. Every member must study French
and one other language—Italian, Spanish or Portuguese;
but if a member wishes to work at three
or all four languages, she will be at liberty to do so.
On receipt of a stamped addressed envelope a trial
lesson will be sent free to anyone.” Further particulars
may be obtained on application.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Selecta</span> and <span class="smcap">First Class</span> of <span class="smcap">Fräulein Green’s
School, Hamburg</span>.—We are very glad, dear girls,
to hear that our paper finds its way to you and gives
you pleasure. You must have made excellent progress
in English when you can read it as a recreation,
not merely as a lesson. We should like to
encourage you to persevere. Germans have understood
and commented upon our greatest author,
Shakespeare, better even than we English have
done, and we owe your country a great literary
debt. We hope that in days to come you may each
be able to appreciate, not only the great books of
your own country, but the great books of ours—and
then you will never regret any toil or trouble
spent in learning the English language.</p></div>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">An Old Subscriber.</span>—Visiting-cards, as such, should
not be sent by post under any circumstances. The
enclosure of cards with a piece of wedding-cake
only serves to indicate whence the latter comes.
They are not sent as visiting-cards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scientist.</span>—The writer of the articles on “House-Mottoes”
has been questioned on the subject of
the old house in Lancashire, known as “Bradley
Hall.” That it may be identified as being reduced
to the position of a farm-house is all she can
suggest. She was not aware that any other ancient
country seats existed in Lancashire, all of them
known by the same name; and is surprised to hear
that there are “several.” “The Herald’s Visitations”
of the county might afford the information
required.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethelinda</span> writes a good legible free hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our Dick.</span>—The game called “kiss-in-the-ring” is
not one played by the higher classes of society.
Amongst others less reserve is unfortunately
permitted. In any case such familiarity between
young men and women is inexpedient. Blues,
greens, and violet are the colours which best suit
red or chestnut hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. E. Morgan.</span>—We thank you for your list of places
where used postage-stamps may be sent for the
benefit of the Asylum for Girls at Le Locle, Neuchâtel,
Switzerland. We are well acquainted with
the “Asile des Billodes,” and have often both
written about it in the “G. O. P.,” but contribute
largely to it annually, direct to a native friend.
However, we will give our readers two addresses,
with which you have favoured us, viz., the Swiss
Home, Mechlenburg Square, W.C., and Messrs.
Loizeaux Bros., 63, Fourth Avenue, New York.
We inquired of a Swiss friend how such stamps
were made available for the benefit of the charity,
and she said she believed, though she was not sure,
that they were sent to Nuremberg for the purpose
of making <i>papier maché</i>. We give her conjecture
for what it may be worth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Haha.</span>—If the dust coming out of the wood you name
be consequent on “dry-rot”—a decay of the wood—it
is connected with the growth of a minute plant
belonging to the tribe of <i>fungi</i>, which spreads with
wonderful rapidity, and feeds on the juice of the
wood. Of course, if the wood be infested with
vermin, you can ascertain that fact for yourself by
examining it with a microscope, and observing any
movement, if there be such.</p>



<p><span class="smcap">Excelsior.</span>—The character begins to be formed in
early childhood, but the judgment takes a good
many years to come to maturity, and in some not
till five-and-twenty or later, and remains defective
the whole life through with others. From the
character of your letter, we should say that your
state of health has a great influence on your excitable
and unhappy frame of mind. You are also
striving by fits and starts to “be good” in your
own strength, instead of telling your Heavenly
Father your temptations, doubts, and frequent
falls, and asking for the help of the Holy Spirit.
He has said, “My grace is sufficient for thee; for
My strength shall be made perfect in weakness.”
Pray for grace to look away from self and its insufficiency
to Christ, Who hath “borne our sins,”
and “by Whose stripes we are healed.” Live
from day to day; do not forestall temptations and
imaginary failures. “Sufficient unto the day is the
evil thereof.”</p>

<p>W. A. B. E.—The “best man” leads out the bride’s
eldest sister (or first bridesmaid), and the others may
follow escorted by the other gentlemen near relatives
(single men). The bride cuts the cake in the first
instance, and she deputes any of the young men—brother
or “best man”—to cut up what is required.</p></div>

<h3>FIRST PRIZE ESSAY.</h3>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">When My Ship Comes Home.</span>”</p>

<div class="blockquot">



<p><span class="smcap">From</span> childhood Harry Millbrooke resolved to marry
Chatty Reeve when his ship came home. Now,
Chatty declines to face the drudgery and monotony
of domestic life. Harry regrets that she is influenced
by her sister’s family worries, but he will not say
good-bye to the old dream. Chatty determines to
be a strong-minded spinster seeking her fortune in
London where employment on the staff of a journal
is promised by Joan Atherstone. Leaving Harry
amidst the ruins of his fairy palace, she bids farewell
to Audrey Woodville whose ship has come home with
a lover who, after seven years’ absence, seeks his
freedom. Audrey soars above her own trial, warns
Chatty that she will not find the wilderness a paradise,
and cheers Harry by assuring him that his ship
will come home.</p>

<p>Chatty is disillusioned in London. The boarding-house
is crowded. Some of its inmates are noisy and
selfish. Poverty and care are stamped on all faces.
Existence is a sad, despairing struggle. Joan forsakes
the office in the Strand for a bicycle tour, and
leaves Chatty to endure the burden of extra work in
a stifling atmosphere. The country girl pines for the
fresh breezes and sparkling waves of Northsea. She
perceives the blessings she has cast away and the
home she has despised. Chatty is lonely when
Phœbe goes to keep house for an uncle, and after
Esther’s wedding she feels an out-of-date regret that
while her friend is happy on the old lines, she is
unhappy on the new.</p>

<p>The climax comes. Faint and bewildered in crossing
the street, Chatty regains consciousness in a hospital.
When welcomed to her sister’s home she has changed
from a self-reliant girl to a reserved woman. Barbara
and Edward Purcell are very kind to her, and she
resumes her post of governess, but all the old ties
cannot be renewed so easily. Harry Millbrooke is
in Copenhagen, and his mother has adopted pretty
Etta Churton. Chatty reflects with a sigh that when
her ship came home she sent it again to sea.</p>

<p>One balmy autumn day Harry returns and finds
Chatty on the sea-shore. “Has my ship come
home?” he asks. The answer is, “Yes, with torn
sail and almost a wreck! But I know where my true
haven is. I never want to go back to the waves of
this troublesome world. I am safe in port at last.”</p>

<p>So this story, which our beloved authoress has
woven round an attractive title, depicts the spirit of
the age—the cry for emancipated womanhood, and
ends to the happy music of wedding bells.</p></div>
